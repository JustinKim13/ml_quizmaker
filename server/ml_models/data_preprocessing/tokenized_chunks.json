(credit: \nmodification of work by NASA/Concepts of Biology OpenStax ) \nViewed from space, Earth offers very few clues about the diversity of life forms that can be \nfound there. The first forms of life on Earth are thought to have been microorganisms that \nexisted for billions of years before plants and animals appeared. Mammals, b irds, and flowers are \nall relatively recent additions to the planet, originating 130 to 200 million years ago. Humans \nhave only inhabited this planet for the last 2.5 million years, and only in the last 200,000 years \nhave humans started looking like we do today. \n1.1 Themes and Concepts of Biology", "Biology is the science that studies life. What exactly is life? This may sound like a silly question \nwith an obvious answer; however, it is not always easy to define life. For example, a branch of \nbiology called virology studies viruses. Viruses exhibit some of t he characteristics of life but \nlack others. It turns out that although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases, and \neven reproduce with the help of host cells, they do not meet all the criteria that biologists use to \ndefine life.  \nFrom its earli est beginnings, biology has wrestled with four questions: What are the shared \nproperties that make something \u201calive\u201d? How do those various living things function? Planet", "2  Return to Table of Contents  earth has a diversity of life forms; how do we organize and classify these different o rganisms? Finally, how did this diversity arise, and how is it continuing? As new organisms are discovered \nevery day, biologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions. Properties of Life  \nAll living organisms share the following key characte ristics: order, response to stimuli, \nreproduction, adaptation, growth and development, homeostasis, and energy processing. These \nseven characteristics serve to define life. It is essential that students know these different \nproperties of life and be able t o explain each. Order \nOrganisms are highly organized and consist of one or more cells. Even very simple, single -celled \norganisms are remarkably complex. Inside each cell, atoms come together through chemical \nbonding and form molecules. Molecules come toge ther to form cell components or structures \ncalled organelles.", "Like the toad shown in Figure 1.2, \nmulticellular organisms can consist of millions of \ncells. Different groups of cells then specialize in \nperforming specific functions. Without order, \nspecialization would not be possible. Figure 1.2 A toad represents a highly organized  \nindividual. (credit: \"Ivengo(RUS)\" /Wikimedia \nCommons )", "Response to Stimuli  \nOrganisms respond to diverse stimuli. For example, plants can bend toward a source of light or \nrespond to touch (Figure 1.3). Even tiny bacte ria can move toward or away from chemicals, a \nprocess called chemotaxis. A movement toward a stimulus is considered a positive response, \nwhile movement away from a stimulus is regarded as a negative response.  \nHumans also respond to stimuli. For example, when we become warm on a hot sunny day, the \nbody has tiny glands called sudoriferous, or sweat, \nglands that make and release sweat onto the skin's \nsurface. The heat from the body can be transferred to \nthe sweat, which acts as a cooling mechanism a nd \nhelps to maintain constant body temperature.  \nFigure 1.3 The leaves of this sensitive plant ( Mimosa \npudica) will instantly droop and fold when touched. \nAfter a few minutes, the plant returns to its normal \nstate. (credit: Alex Lomas /Concepts of Biology \nOpenStax )", "Access for free at https://openstax.org/   3 CONCEPTS IN ACTION - Watch this video to see how the sensitive plant responds to a touch \nstimulus.  \nReproduction  \nReproduction is necessary on both a cellular and organismal level. For a population to survive, \nsome individuals with in that population must reproduce. Organisms that are multicellular, such \nas plants and animals, also need to reproduce on a cellular level. As old cells become damaged or \nworn out, they must be replaced by new cells. For example, \nskin cells are damaged co ntinuously and need to be replaced \nevery two to three weeks; otherwise, the skin would lose its \nability to provide protection.  \nSingle-celled organisms must also reproduce. Reproduction \nbegins by first duplicating their genetic material. Once the \ngenetic ma terial is duplicated, it is then divided equally into \ntwo new cells (Figure 1.4). The two new daughter cells should \nbe identical to the parent cell.", "Adaptation  \nAll living organisms exhibit a \u201cfit\u201d to their environment. Biologists refer to this fit as \nadaptation. Adaptations are a consequence of evo lution by natural selection. Evolution has had \nsome impact on every lineage of reproducing organisms. Examples of adaptations are diverse \nand unique. For example, some microorganisms live in boiling hot springs, whereas some moths \nhave tongues the exact le ngth of the flower from which they feed. Adaptations are vital because they enhance an individual's ability to survive and reproduce; \nhowever, adaptations are not constant. As an environment changes, natural selection causes the \nindividuals in a population  to adapt to those changes. For example, imagine that there is a population of finches living on an island. An environmental \nevent has resulted in two main food sources : soft insects and hard seeds. Not all finches within \nthe population have the same beak length or size.", "Finches in the population that have long, \nskinny beaks begin to feed on soft insects because they are easy for those birds to catch and eat . Finches with large, more dense beaks feed on hard seeds because their dense beaks allow them to", "4  Return to Table of Contents  crush and open the hard seeds. Unfortunately, finches that have beaks that are neither long nor \ndense may slowly begin to decline in number because they are limited in their ability to obtain \nnutrients. Finches that obtain food can put energy into reproduction and survival needs. When \nthose finches reproduce, they pass along those adaptations that a llow them to be successful in \ntheir respective feeding environments. Over time two distinct groups may arise, those with thick, \ndense beaks and those with longer skinnier beaks (Figure 1.5). If these individuals genetically \nchange in such a way that they n o longer can interbreed with one another, a speciation event will \nhave occurred.", "Figure 1.5 Different finch phenotype variations \ndue to environmental changes. (credit: National Human Genome Research \nInstitute's Talking Glossary /Wikimedia \nCommons ) \nGrowth and Development  \nDevelopment is often described as the processes that an individual goes through as it grows and \nmatures. For example, i n humans, development begins once the sperm fertilizes the egg. Human \ndevelopment can be broken down into different stages including embryonic development, fetal \ndevelopment, infancy, childhood, puberty, and adulthood. Development can also be observed in \nmany other organisms. For example, b utterflies go through a developmental process called \nmetamorphosis  that begins at the egg stage and  then proceeds to the larva, pupa, and adult stages. Both multicellular and single -celled organisms grow and develop acc ording to specific \ninstructions encoded in their DNA. DNA is organized into genes that provide information for \ncellular growth and development.", "Figure 1.6 Although no two looks alike, these \nkittens have inherited genes from both parents and \nshare many of the same characteristics.

Homeostasis  or \u201csteady state\u201d is the ability of an \norganism to regulate and maintain constant internal conditions.", "Cells require appropriate conditions such as proper temperature, pH, and concentrations of \nnutrients to function correctly. Although these conditions may  change, organisms can maintain \ninternal conditions within a narrow range. For example, many organisms regulate their body \ntemperature in a process known as thermoregulation. Organisms that live in cold climates, such \nas the polar bear (Figure 1.8), have b ody structures such as thick layers of fur or fat, which help \nthem withstand low temperatures and conserve body heat. In hot climates, plants carry out \nunique versions of photosynthesis to reduce water loss and optimize their potential of making \nsugar.", "Figure 1.8a.

Students that continue and take \nAnatomy and Physiology classes will spend time discussing how the body works to maintain \nhomeostasis. Students will also look at what occurs when the body loses its ability to mai ntain \nstable internal conditions, otherwise referred to as a homeostatic imbalance.", "Energy Processing  \nAll organisms, including the California condor shown in Figure 1.10, use a source of energy for \ntheir metabolic activities. Some organis ms can obtain energy through metabolic pathways such \nas photosynthesis.  Photosynthesis is a process where light energy can be captured and converted \ninto chemical energy. Organisms that are capable of making their own chemical energy are \nreferred to as autotrophs . Others must obtain their chemical energy by consuming other \norganisms. These individuals are referred to as heterotrophs . Regardless of whether an \norganism is an autotroph or a heterotroph, all living cells must have energy to drive metabolism.", "Access for free at https://openstax.org/   7 Levels of Organization of Living Things  \nLiving things are highly organized and structured. The atom is the \nsmallest and most fundamental unit of matter. It consists of a \nnucleus surrounded by electrons. Atoms form molecules. A \nmolecule  is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms \nheld together by a chemical bond. Many biologically important \nmolecules are macromolecules. A macromolecule  is a large \nmolecule that is typically formed by combining smaller molecules. \nFor example, nucleotides are small molecules linked together to \nform the macromolecule, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) (Figure \n1.11). DN A contains the instructions necessary for cells and \norganisms to maintain homeostasis.", "CONCEPTS IN ACTION - To see an animation of this DNA molecule, click here. Some cells contain collections of macromolecules surrounded by membranes; these are called \norganelles. Organelles  are small structures that exist within cells and perform specialized \nfunctions. For example, in some cells, DNA is enclosed within a membrane -bound organelle \ncalled the nucleus (plural: nuclei). All living things are made of cells; the cell is the smallest \nfundamental unit found in living organisms. Cells exhibit all of the properties of life discussed \nabove. Viruses are often not considered liv ing because they are not made of cells , nor are they \ncapable of reproducing on their own. To make new viruses, they must invade and take over a \nliving cell. Some organisms  consist of a single cell, while others are multicellular. In most multicellular \norganisms, cells combine to make tissues, which are groups of similar cells carrying out the \nsame function.", "Organs are collections of tissues grouped based on a common function. Organs \nare present not only in animals but also in plants. An organ system  is a higher level of \norganization that consists of functionally related organs. For example, vertebrate animals have \nmany organ systems, such as the circulatory system that transports blood throughout the body; it \nincludes organs such as the heart and blood vesse ls. Organisms  are individual living entities. For \nexample, each tree in a forest is an organism. Single -celled prokaryotes and single -celled \neukaryotes are also considered organisms and are typically referred to as microorganisms.", "Figure 1.12 From an atom to the entire Earth, \nbiology examines all aspects of life.

The \nforest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants, insects, and microbial \npopulations. A community  is the set of populations inhabiting a particular area. For instance, all \nthe trees, flowers, in sects, and other populations in a forest form the forest\u2019s community. The \nforest itself is an ecosystem. An ecosystem  consists of all the living things in a particular area \ntogether with the abiotic , or non-living, parts of that environment, such as nitrogen in the soil or \nrainwater. At the highest level of organization (Figure 1.12), the biosphere  is the collection of all \necosystems on planet Earth.", "Answer: (b) \nThe Diversity of Life  \nThe science of biology is very broad because there is a tremendous diversity of life on Earth. The \nsource of this diversity is evolution. Evolution  is the process of genetic change in a population. Evolution helps explain how new species can arise from old er species. Speciation events can \noccur when individuals within a population are separated and begin to change or evolve \nindependently of one another. If the individuals change to the point where they can no longer \ninterbreed, a speciation event has occurr ed, and species diversity has increased. Evolution will be \ndiscussed in much greater detail in chapter 11. In the 18th century, a  Swedish scientist named Carl Linnaeus first proposed organizing living \norganisms into a hierarchical taxonomy. In this system,  species that are most similar to each \nother are put together within a grouping known as a genus. Furthermore, similar genera (the \nplural of genus) are put together within a family.", "This grouping continues until all organisms are \ncollected together into gr oups at the highest level.

The \ndomain Eukarya is very diverse and includes the kingdoms of fungi, plants, animals, and several \nkingdoms of protists. Humans, plants, yeast, and mushrooms are just a few representatives of the \ndomain Eukarya . These organisms are classified as eukaryotes  because they have nuclei and \nother membrane -bound organelles. Both the Archaea and Bacteria are single -celled organisms \nclassified as prokaryotes (Figure 1.14). Prokaryotes  are organisms that lack nuclei and o ther \nmembrane -bound organelles.

It is quite a broad branch itself, and depending on the \nsubject of study, there are also microbial physiologis ts, ecologists, and geneticists, among others.  \nPaleontology, another branch of biology, uses fossils to study life\u2019s history (Figure 1.16). \nZoology and botany are the study of animals and plants, respectively.

Specifically, \nbiology is the study of life. Biological discoveries are made by a community of researchers who \nwork both individually and together using agreed -on methods. The methods of science include \ncareful observation, record keeping, logical and mathematical reasoning, ex perimentation, and \nsubmitting conclusions to the scrutiny of others. Science also requires considerable imagination \nand creativity; a well -designed experiment is commonly described as elegant or beautiful. \nScience has significant practical implications and  applications, for example, in the prevention of \ndisease (Figure 1.19). Other types of science are motivated by curiosity. Whatever its goal, there \nis no doubt that science, including biology, has transformed human existence and will continue \nto do so."]
