Miriam Cooke, 2007 P R E F A C E I wrote this novel after an encounter between me and a woman in Qanatir Prison.

The idea of \u2018prison\u2019 had always exercised a special attraction for me. I often wondered what prison life was like, especially for women.

Isn\u2019t all this su\ufb03cient for you? Why do you ask for more?\u2019 It was not out of greed that I was thinking of other things. One morning I had opened the window as usual, but the Nile was no longer there. I knew the Nile was in the same place, its waters stretched out before my eyes, but I could no longer see it, as though the human eye is incapable of seeing what is within its reach. The perfumes which ", "see it, as though the human eye is incapable of seeing what is within its reach. The perfumes which I had all around me, under my nose, they too had disappeared. I was unable to detect their odour, as though my nose, just like my eyes, could no longer register the things which were there in front of it. The softness, the silk, the comfortable bed, all the things I knew were still there, no longer existed for me. I never used to leave the house. In fact, I never even left the bedroom.

There were so many of them. I did not understand where they could possibly have come from. For they were all married, all educated, all carrying swollen leather bags, and swollen leather wallets in their inner pockets. Their swollen heavy paunches hung down with too much food, and their sweat ran copiously, \ufb01lling my nostrils with a foetid smell, like sta", " with too much food, and their sweat ran copiously, \ufb01lling my nostrils with a foetid smell, like stagnant water, as though it had been held back in their bodies for a long time. I turned my face away, but they insisted on pulling it back, on burying my nose in the smell of their bodies. They dug their long nails into my \ufb02esh and I would close my lips tightly trying to sti\ufb02e any expression of pain, to hold back a scream, but in spite of my e\ufb00orts they would part and let out a low, mu\ufb04ed moan.

Often the man would hear it and mutter stupidly in my ear, \u2018Do you feel good?\u2019 In answer I would purse my lips and prepare to spit in his face, but he would start biting them with his teeth. I could feel his thick saliva between my lips and with a push of the tongue sent it back into his mouth. Among all these men there was only one man who was not stupid, and did not ask me if I was feeling good. Instead he queried, \u2018Do yo", "nly one man who was not stupid, and did not ask me if I was feeling good. Instead he queried, \u2018Do you feel any pain?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 I said. \u2018What\u2019s your name?\u2019 \u2018Firdaus.

Do you also feel me?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t feel anything.\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 \u2018I do not know.

He wiped my tears away and took me in his arms. I closed my eyes and he kissed me gently on the lids. I heard him whisper: \u2018Do you want to sleep?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Then sleep in my arms.\u2019 \u2018But what about Sharifa?\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t be afraid of Sharifa.\u2019 \u2018And you?

I heard her speaking to a man whose voice sounded familiar. \u2018You\u2019re going to take her away from me?\u2019 \u2018I shall marry her, Sharifa.\u2019 \u2018Not you.

She\u2019s making money out of you.\u2019 Then came Sharifa\u2019s voice as she said: \u2018If you hit me, Fawzy, I will hit back.\u2019 I opened my eyes. My body was stretched out on the bed without a man beside me, and the room around was dark and empty.

The movement of my hand as I clasped the ten pound note solved the enigma in one swift, sweeping movement, tore away the shroud that covered up a truth I had in fact experienced when still a child, when for the \ufb01rst time my father gave me a piastre, a coin to hold in my hand, and be mine.

And on those days when there was no food left over from him, I went to bed without supper. On the Eed El Kebir I saw the children buy candy from a sweetshop. I went to my mother crying loudly \u2018Give me a piastre.\u2019 She answered, \u2018I have no piastres.

The movement of my hand had become very easy, and everything in my hand could be moved with a natural ease, even if it were a sharp knife which I thrust into a chest and then withdrew. It would penetrate in and come out with the natural ease of air entering the lungs and then \ufb02owing out. I am speaking the tru", " come out with the natural ease of air entering the lungs and then \ufb02owing out. I am speaking the truth now without any di\ufb03culty. For the truth is always easy and simple. And in its simplicity lies a savage power. I only arrived at the savage, primitive truths of life after years of struggle. For it is only very rarely that people can arrive at the simple, but awesome and powerful truths of life after only a few years. And to have arrived at the truth means that one no longer fears death. For death and truth", "ew years. And to have arrived at the truth means that one no longer fears death. For death and truth are similar in that they both require a great courage if one wishes to face them. And truth is like death in that it kills. When I killed I did it with truth not with a knife. That is why they are afraid and in a hurry to execute me. They do not fear my knife. It is my truth which frightens them. This fearful truth gives me great strength. It protects me from fearing death, or life, or hunger, or nakedness, ", "truth gives me great strength. It protects me from fearing death, or life, or hunger, or nakedness, or destruction. It is this fearful truth which prevents me from fearing the brutality of rulers and policemen. I spit with ease on their lying faces and words, on their lying newspapers. 3 Firdaus\u2019 voice suddenly fell silent, like a voice in a dream. I moved my body like someone moving in sleep. What lay under me was not a bed, but something solid like the ground, and cold like the ground, yet with a coldness", "me was not a bed, but something solid like the ground, and cold like the ground, yet with a coldness which did not reach my body. It was the cold of the sea in a dream. I swam through its waters. I was naked and knew not how to swim. But I neither felt its cold, nor drowned in its waters. Her voice was now silent, but its echo remained in my ears, like a faint distant sound. Like the voices one hears in a dream. They seem to come from afar although they arise from close by, or seem to be nearby although the", "am. They seem to come from afar although they arise from close by, or seem to be nearby although they come from afar. We do not know in fact from where they arise. From above or below. To our left or our right. We might even think they come from the depths of the earth, drop from the rooftops or fall from the heavens. Or they might even \ufb02ow from all directions, like air moving in space reaches our ears. But this was not air \ufb02owing into my ears. The woman sitting on the ground in front of me was a real woman", "his was not air \ufb02owing into my ears. The woman sitting on the ground in front of me was a real woman. The voice \ufb01lling my ears with its sound, echoing in the cell where the window and the door were tightly closed, was a real voice. And I was certainly awake. For suddenly the door was thrown open, revealing several armed policemen. They surrounded her in a circle, and I heard one of them say: \u2018Let\u2019s go\u2026 Your time has come.\u2019 I saw her walk out with them. I never saw her again. But her voice continued to echo ", "ime has come.\u2019 I saw her walk out with them. I never saw her again. But her voice continued to echo in my ears, vibrating in my head, in the cell, in the prison, in the streets, in the whole world, shaking everything, spreading fear wherever it went, the fear of the truth which kills, the power of truth, as savage, and as simple, and as awesome as death, yet as simple and as gentle as the child that has not yet learnt to lie. And because the world was full of lies, she had to pay the price. I got into my li", "et learnt to lie. And because the world was full of lies, she had to pay the price. I got into my little car, my eyes on the ground. Inside of me was a feeling of shame. I felt ashamed of myself, of my life, of my fears, and my lies. The streets were full of people bustling around, of newspapers hanging on wooden stalls, their headlines crying out. At every step, wherever I went, I could see the lies, could follow hypocrisy bustling around. I rammed my foot down on the accelerator as though in a hurry to ru", "ollow hypocrisy bustling around. I rammed my foot down on the accelerator as though in a hurry to run over the world, to stamp it all out. But the next moment I quickly lifted my foot and braked hard, and the car came to a halt. And at that moment I realized that Firdaus had more courage than I.
