ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Nawal El Saadawi is an internationally renowned writer,
novelist and ﬁghter for women’s rights both within Egypt
and abroad.
Born in 1931, in a village outside Cairo, she wrote her ﬁrst
novel, Diary of a Child Called Souad, at the age of thirteen.
Unusually, she and her brothers and sisters were educated
together. After graduating from the University of Cairo
Medical School in 1955, specializing in psychiatry, she
practised as a medical doctor for two years.
From 1963 until 1972, Saadawi worked for the Egyptian
government as Director General for Public Health Education.
During this time, she studied at Columbia University in New
York, where she received her Master’s degree in Public
Health in 1966. In 1972, however, she lost her job in the
government as a result of political pressure. The magazine
Health, which she founded and had edited for more than
three years, was closed down.
From 1973 to 1978 Saadawi worked at the High Institute
of Literature and Science. It was at this time that she began
to write, in works of ﬁction and non-ﬁction, the books on the
oppression of Arab women for which she has become
famous. Her most renowned novel, Woman at Point Zero,
was published in Beirut in 1973. It was followed in 1976 by
God Dies by the Nile and in 1977 by her study of Arab
women, The Hidden Face of Eve.
In 1981 Nawal El Saadawi publicly criticized the one-party
rule of President Anwar Sadat, and was subsequently
arrested and imprisoned. She was released one month after
Sadat’s assassination. In 1982, she established the Arab
Women’s Solidarity Association, which was outlawed in
1991. For some years during the Mubarak regime, Saadawi
lived in exile, teaching in universities in the USA and Europe,
including Duke University and Washington State University.
Saadawi returned to Egypt in 1996. In 2004 she presented
herself as a candidate for the presidential elections in Egypt,
with a platform of human rights, democracy and greater
freedom for women. In July 2005, however, she was forced
to withdraw her candidacy in the face of ongoing
government persecution.
Nawal El Saadawi has achieved widespread international
recognition for her work. She holds honorary doctorates
from, among others, the universities of York, Illinois at
Chicago, St Andrews and Tromso as well as Universidad
Nacional Autónoma de México. Her many prizes and awards
include the Premi Internacional Catalunya in 2003, the
Council of Europe North–South Prize in 2004, the Women of
the Year Award (UK) in 2011, the Sean MacBride Peace Prize
(Ireland) in 2012, and the French National Order of Merit in
2013. Her books have been translated into over forty
languages worldwide. They are taught in universities across
the world.

Firdaus is known around the world. It’s true. From Jakarta to
Jeddah to Jerusalem and Johannesburg, Muslim and non-
Muslim women know this woman, this heroine of Woman at
Point Zero. This novel, or rather creative non-ﬁction, takes
the reader into the cell of a woman the night before her
execution.
We enter tentatively and sit quietly, unobtrusively near
the door. The room is dark and the air thick with sadness,
despair and doom. Gradually, the darkness lightens as our
eyes become accustomed to it and we watch a drama
unfold between two ﬁgures whose interchange will remain
forever emblazoned on our minds.
A psychiatrist and a dead-woman-walking confront each
other at last. The psychiatrist has wanted to meet Firdaus
for weeks, but the prisoner has consistently refused. Then,
on her last night on earth she decides to tell her story.
Slowly at ﬁrst and then faster and more urgently, Firdaus
recounts a lifetime of betrayal and abuse. She is an orphan
who was passed from one abusive guardian to another, and
her tale shows how trust is tested and ﬁnally erodes, leaving
behind only fear and alienation. The person who has been
deprived of the ability to trust lives on the margins of
society; she is only barely human. Such a person lives by
instinct, without calculation beyond the immediate need to
survive the moment.
It does not matter if this story is true or made up, or a bit
of both (which it is). What matters is that it unfolds a
universal tragedy as great as any of Sophocles, even if
without the epic heroes. Unity of time, place and action
works once again to pull the spectator into a place of pain
that is utterly particular to the players but also universal.
Readers cannot but be drawn into the catastrophe of
Firdaus’s life in such a way that her hopes and
disappointments become theirs. You do not have to be a lost
little girl to appreciate how great was Firdaus’s need for her
uncle and how terrible the shock when he abused her. You
do not have to be a sex worker to understand how
circumstances threw her into the pit of prostitution and how
the demons drove her to murder her pimp.
Years of teaching this extraordinary book have conﬁrmed
what I felt when I ﬁrst read it decades ago. This is a story
that reaches everyone regardless of their gender,
nationality or station in life. Read the comments on sites like
Amazon for surprised reactions to this book. They all go
something like: ‘Assigned this book in class, I picked it up
with indiﬀerence and could not put it down.’ This, I am sure,
will be your response also.

P R E F A C E 
I wrote this novel after an encounter between me and a
woman in Qanatir Prison. A few months before, I had started
research on neurosis in Egyptian women, and was able to
concentrate most of my time on this work as I was then
without a job. At the end of 1972 the Minister of Health had
removed from me my functions as Director of Health
Education and Editor-in-Chief of the magazine Health. This
was one more consequence of the path I had chosen as a
feminist author and novelist whose ideas were viewed
unfavourably by the authorities.
However, this situation gave me more time to think, to
write, to research, and to deal with the consultations which I
conducted with women who came to see me. The year 1973
saw a new stage of my life; it also witnessed the birth of my
novel Firdaus, or Woman at Point Zero.
The idea for my research in fact arose as a result of the
women who sought my advice and help to deal with
situations which had led to a greater or lesser degree of
‘mental aﬄiction’. I decided to choose a limited number of
cases from amongst women suﬀering from neurosis, and
this entailed regular visits to a number of hospitals and
outpatient clinics.
The idea of ‘prison’ had always exercised a special
attraction for me. I often wondered what prison life was like,
especially for women. Perhaps this was because I lived in a
country where many prominent intellectuals around me had
spent various periods of time in prison for ‘political
oﬀences’. My husband had been imprisoned for thirteen
years as a ‘political detainee’. So that when one day I
happened to meet one of the doctors from the Women’s
Prison in Qanatir I was irresistibly drawn to exchange ideas
with him; whenever we met we would stop and talk. He told
me many things about the women prisoners gaoled for
diﬀerent oﬀences, and especially about those who suﬀered
degrees of neurosis, and who attended the weekly mental
clinic of the Qanatir Prison Hospital.
I became more and more interested, and slowly the idea
of visiting the prison to see the women there grew on me.
The only time I had seen inside a prison was in ‘political
ﬁlms’, but now I had the opportunity to visit a real one. The
idea grew even more compelling when my friend the prison
doctor began to tell me, at length, about a woman who had
killed a man and was under sentence of death by hanging. I
had never seen a woman who had killed.
The prison doctor said he would take me to see her, and
show me other women prisoners who suﬀered from mental
aﬄictions. Through him I was enabled to obtain a special
permit to visit Qanatir Prison as a psychiatrist and to
examine the women. He became so interested in what I
planned to undertake that he accompanied me as far as the
prison and showed me around once we were inside.
The instant I stepped through the prison gates I was
overcome by sudden gloom at the sight of the sullen
buildings, the iron-barred windows and the overall
harshness of the surroundings. A shiver went through my
body. Little did I know that one day I would step through the
same gates, not as a psychiatrist, but as a prisoner arrested
with 1,035 others under the decree issued by Sadat on 5
September 1981. On that particular morning in the autumn
of 1974, however, the possibility of being conﬁned behind
the high, bare, yellowish walls never occurred to me. As I
crossed the inner courtyards I could glimpse the faces of the
women, lurking behind the iron bars like animals, their white
or brown ﬁngers twisted around the black metal.
Firdaus at ﬁrst refused to receive me in her cell, but later
she agreed to meet me. Little by little she was brought to
tell me her story, the whole story of her life. It was a terrible
yet wonderful story. As she unfolded her life before me, I
learnt more and more about her. I developed a feeling and
admiration for this woman who seemed to me so
exceptional in the world of women to which I was
accustomed. So, later, the day came when I began to think
of writing the novel which came to be known as Woman at
Point Zero or Firdaus.
But for the time being I found myself occupied with the
many women whom my doctor friend showed me in the
cells and in the mental clinic, for they were to constitute a
part of the twenty in-depth case studies included in my
research, the results of which were published in 1976, under
the title Women and Neurosis in Egypt.
Firdaus, however, remained a woman apart. She stood out
amongst the others, vibrated within me, or sometimes lay
quiet, until the day when I put her down in ink on paper and
gave her life after she had died. For, at the end of 1974,
Firdaus was executed, and I never saw her again. And yet
somehow she was always before my eyes. I could see her in
front of me, trace the lines of her forehead, her lips, her
eyes, watch her as she moved with pride. When, in autumn
1981, it was my turn to be conﬁned behind bars, I would
watch the other women prisoners, as they moved through
the inner courtyard, as though I was looking for her, trying
to glimpse her head which she always held so high, the
calm movements of her hands, or the stern look of her
brown eyes. I could not bring myself to believe that she had
really died.
During the three months I spent in gaol I met a number of
women who were accused of having killed a man, some of
whom reminded me of Firdaus; yet none of them was like
her. She remained unique. Not only her features, her
carriage, her courage, or the way she was wont to look at
me from the depths of her eyes, distinguished her from
other women, but her absolute refusal to live, her absolute
fearlessness of death.
Firdaus is the story of a woman driven by despair to the
darkest of ends. This woman, despite her misery and
despair, evoked in all those who, like me, witnessed the ﬁnal
moments of her life, a need to challenge and to overcome
those forces that deprive human beings of their right to live,
to love and to real freedom.

WOMAN AT
POINT ZERO
1 
This is the story of a real woman. I met her in the Qanatir
Prison a few years ago. I was doing research on the
personalities of a group of women prisoners and detainees
convicted or accused of various oﬀences.
The prison doctor told me that this woman had been
sentenced to death for killing a man. Yet she was not like
the other female murderers held in the prison.
‘You will never meet anyone like her in or out of prison.
She refuses all visitors, and won’t speak to anyone. She
usually leaves her food untouched, and remains wide awake
until dawn. Sometimes the prison warder observes her as
she sits staring vacantly into space for hours. One day she
asked for pen and paper, then spent hours hunched over
them without moving. The warder could not tell whether she
was writing a letter or something else. Perhaps she was not
writing anything at all.’
I asked the prison doctor, ‘Will she see me?’
‘I shall try to persuade her to speak to you for a while,’ he
said. ‘She might agree if I explain you are a psychiatrist, and
not one of the Public Prosecutor’s assistants. She refuses to
answer my questions. She even refused to sign an appeal to
the President so that her sentence might be commuted to
imprisonment for life.’
‘Who made out the appeal for her?’ I asked.
‘I did,’ he said. ‘To be quite honest, I do not really feel she
is a murderer. If you look into her face, her eyes, you will
never believe that so gentle a woman can commit murder.’
‘Who says murder does not require that a person be
gentle?’
He stared at me in surprise for a brief moment, and then
laughed nervously.
‘Have you ever killed anybody?’
‘Am I a gentle woman?’ I replied.
He turned his head to one side, pointed to a tiny window,
and said, ‘That’s her cell. I’ll go and persuade her to come
down and meet you.’
After a while he came back without her. Firdaus had
refused to see me.
I was supposed to examine some other women prisoners
that day, but instead I got into my car and drove away.
Back home I could not do anything. I had to revise the
draft of my latest book, but I was incapable of
concentrating. I could think of nothing but the woman called
Firdaus who, in ten days’ time, would be led to the gallows.
Early next morning I found myself at the prison gates
again. I asked the warder to let me see Firdaus, but she
said: ‘It’s no use, Doctor. She will never agree to see you.’
‘Why?’
‘They’re going to hang her in a few days’ time. What use
are you, or anybody else to her? Leave her alone!’
There was a note of anger in her voice. She gave me a
look charged with wrath, as though I was the one who would
hang Firdaus in a few days’ time.
‘I have nothing to do with the authorities either here or
any other place,’ I said.
‘That’s what they all say,’ she said angrily.
‘Why are you so worked up?’ I asked. ‘Do you think
Firdaus is innocent, that she didn’t kill him?’
She replied with an added fury, ‘Murderer or not, she’s an
innocent woman and does not deserve to be hanged. They
are the ones that ought to hang.’
‘They? Who are they?’
She looked at me with suspicion and said, ‘Tell me rather,
who are you? Did they send you to her?’
‘Whom do you mean by “they”?’ I asked again.
She looked around cautiously, almost with fear, and
stepped back away from me.
‘They… You mean to say you don’t know them?’
‘No,’ I said.
She emitted a short, sarcastic laugh and walked oﬀ. I
heard her muttering to herself:
‘How can she be the only one who does not know them?’
* * *
I returned to the prison several times, but all my attempts to
see Firdaus were of no avail. I felt somehow that my
research was now in jeopardy. As a matter of fact, my whole
life seemed to be threatened with failure. My self-conﬁdence
began to be badly shaken, and I went through diﬃcult
moments. It looked to me as though this woman who had
killed a human being, and was shortly to be killed herself,
was a much better person than I. Compared to her, I was
nothing but a small insect crawling upon the land amidst
millions of other insects.
Whenever I remembered the expression in the eyes of the
warder, or the prison doctor, as they spoke of her complete
indiﬀerence to everything, her attitude of total rejection,
and above all her refusal to see me, the feeling that I was
helpless, and of no signiﬁcance grew on me. A question kept
turning round and round in my mind increasingly: What sort
of woman was she? Since she had rejected me, did that
mean she was a better person than me? But then, she had
also refused to send an appeal to the President asking him
to protect her from the gallows. Could that signify that she
was better than the Head of State?
I was seized by a feeling very close to certainty, yet
diﬃcult to explain, that she was, in fact, better than all the
men and women we normally hear about, or see, or know.
I tried to overcome my inability to sleep, but another
thought started to occupy my mind and keep me awake.
When she refused to see me did she know who I was, or had
she rejected me without knowing?
The following morning, I found myself back once more in
the prison. I had no intention of trying to meet Firdaus, for I
had given up all hope. I was looking for the warder, or the
prison doctor. The doctor had not yet arrived but I found the
warder.
‘Did Firdaus tell you she knew me?’ I asked her.
‘No, she did not tell me anything,’ the warder replied. ‘But
she does know you.’
‘How do you know that she knows me?’
‘I can sense her.’
I just stood there as though turned to stone. The warder
left me to get on with her work. I tried to move, to go
towards my car and leave, but in vain. A strange feeling of
heaviness weighed down my heart, my body, drained my
legs of their power. A feeling heavier than the weight of the
whole earth, as though instead of standing above its
surface, I was now lying somewhere beneath it. The sky also
had undergone a change; its colour had turned to black, like
that of the earth, and it was pressing down upon me with its
added load.
It was a feeling I had known only once before, many years
ago. I had fallen in love with a man who did not love me. I
felt rejected, not only by him, not only by one person
amongst the millions that peopled the vast world, but by
every living being or thing on earth, by the vast world itself.
I straightened my shoulders, stood as upright as I could,
and took a deep breath. The weight on my head lifted a
little. I began to look around me and to feel amazed at
ﬁnding myself in the prison at this early hour. The warder
was bent double, scrubbing the tiled ﬂoor of the corridor. I
was overcome by an unusual contempt towards her. She
was no more than a woman cleaning the prison ﬂoor. She
could not read or write and knew nothing about psychology,
so how was it that I had so easily believed her feelings could
be true?
Firdaus did not actually say she knew me. The warder
merely sensed it. Why should that indicate that Firdaus
really knew me? If she had rejected me without knowing
who I was there was no reason for me to feel hurt. Her
refusal to see me was not directed against me personally,
but against the world and everybody in it.
I started to walk towards my car with the intention of
leaving. Subjective feelings such as those that had taken
hold of me were not worthy of a researcher in science. I
almost smiled at myself as I opened the door of the car. The
touch of its surface helped to restore my identity, my self-
esteem as a doctor. Whatever the circumstances, a doctor
was surely to be preferred to a woman condemned to death
for murder. My normal attitude towards myself (an attitude
which rarely deserts me) gradually returned. I turned the
ignition key and pressed my foot down on the accelerator,
ﬁrmly stamping out the sudden feeling (which occasionally
haunts me in moments of failure) of merely being an
insigniﬁcant insect, crawling on the earth amidst myriads of
other similar insects. I heard a voice behind me, rising over
the sound of the engine.
‘Doctor! Doctor!’
It was the warder. She ran up to me panting heavily. Her
gasping voice reminded me of the voices I often heard in my
dreams. Her mouth had grown bigger, and so had her lips,
which kept opening and closing with a mechanical
movement, like a swing door.
I heard her say, ‘Firdaus, Doctor! Firdaus wants to see
you!’
Her breast was heaving up and down, her breathing had
become a series of rapid gasps, and her eyes and face
reﬂected a violent emotion. If the President of the Republic
in person had asked to see me, she could not have been
swept by such an overpowering emotion.
My breathing in turn quickened, as though by infection, or
to be more precise, I felt out of breath, for my heart was
beating more strongly than it had ever done before. I do not
know how I climbed out of the car, nor how I followed so
closely behind the warder that I sometimes overtook her, or
moved ahead. I walked with a rapid, eﬀortless pace, as
though my legs were no longer carrying a body. I was full of
a wonderful feeling, proud, elated, happy. The sky was blue
with a blueness I could capture in my eyes. I held the whole
world in my hands; it was mine. It was a feeling I had known
only once before, many years ago. I was on my way to meet
the ﬁrst man I loved for the ﬁrst time.
I stopped for a moment in front of Firdaus’ cell to catch my
breath and adjust the collar of my dress. But I was trying to
regain my composure, to return to my normal state, to the
realization that I was a researcher in science, a psychiatrist,
or something of the kind. I heard the key grind in the lock,
brutal, screeching. The sound restored me to myself. My
hand tightened its grasp on the leather bag, and a voice
within me said, ‘Who is this woman called Firdaus? She is
only…’
But the words within me stopped short. Suddenly we were
face to face. I stood rooted to the ground, silent, motionless.
I did not hear the beat of my heart, nor the key as it turned
in the lock, closing the heavy door behind me. It was as
though I died the moment her eyes looked into mine. They
were eyes that killed, like a knife, probing, cutting deep
down inside, their look steady, unwavering. Not the slightest
movement of a lid. Not the smallest twitch of a muscle in
the face.
I was brought back suddenly by a voice. The voice was
hers, steady, cutting deep down inside, cold as a knife. Not
the slightest wavering in its tone. Not the smallest shiver of
a note. I heard her say:
‘Close the window.’
I moved up to the window blindly and closed it, then cast
a bemused look around. There was nothing in the cell. Not a
bed, or a chair, or anything on which I could sit down. I
heard her say:
‘Sit down on the ground.’
My body bent down and sat on the ground. It was January
and the ground was bare, but I felt no cold. Like walking in
one’s sleep. The ground under me was cold. The same
touch, the same consistency, the same naked cold. Yet the
cold did not touch me, did not reach me. It was the cold of
the sea in a dream. I swam through its waters. I was naked
and knew not how to swim. But I neither felt its cold, nor
drowned in its waters. Her voice too was like the voices one
hears in a dream. It was close to me, yet seemed to come
from afar, spoke from a distance and seemed to arise from
nearby. For we do not know from where these voices arise:
from above or below, to our left or our right. We might even
think they come from the depths of the earth, drop from the
rooftops, or fall from the heavens. Or they might even ﬂow
from all directions, like air moving in space reaches the
ears.
But this was no dream. This was not air ﬂowing into my
ears. The woman sitting on the ground in front of me was a
real woman, and the voice ﬁlling my ears with its sound,
echoing in a cell where the window and door were tightly
shut, could only be her voice, the voice of Firdaus.
2 
Let me speak. Do not interrupt me. I have no time to listen
to you. They are coming to take me at six o’clock this
evening. Tomorrow morning I shall no longer be here. Nor
will I be in any place known to man. This journey to a place
unknown to everybody on this earth ﬁlls me with pride. All
my life I have been searching for something that would ﬁll
me with pride, make me feel superior to everyone else,
including kings, princes and rulers. Each time I picked up a
newspaper and found the picture of a man who was one of
them, I would spit on it. I knew I was only spitting on a piece
of newspaper which I needed for covering the kitchen
shelves. Nevertheless I spat, and then left the spit where it
was to dry.
Anyone who saw me spitting on the picture might think I
knew that particular man personally. But I did not. I am just
one woman. And there is no single woman who could
possibly know all the men who get their pictures published
in the newspapers. For after all, I was only a successful
prostitute. And no matter how successful a prostitute is, she
cannot get to know all the men. However, every single man
I did get to know ﬁlled me with but one desire: to lift my
hand and bring it smashing down on his face. But because I
am a woman I have never had the courage to lift my hand.
And because I am a prostitute, I hid my fear under layers of
make-up. Since I was successful, my make-up was always of
the best and most expensive kind, just like the make-up of
respectable upper-class women. I always had my hair done
by stylists who tendered their services only to upper-class
society women. The colour I chose for lipstick was always
‘natural and serious’ so that it neither disguised, nor
accentuated the seductiveness of my lips. The skilful lines
pencilled around my eyes hinted at just the right
combination of attraction and rejection favoured by the
wives of men in high positions of authority. Only my make-
up, my hair and my expensive shoes were ‘upper class’.
With my secondary school certiﬁcate and suppressed
desires I belonged to the ‘middle class’. By birth I was lower
class.
* * *
My father, a poor peasant farmer, who could neither read
nor write, knew very few things in life. How to grow crops,
how to sell a buﬀalo poisoned by his enemy before it died,
how to exchange his virgin daughter for a dowry when there
was still time, how to be quicker than his neighbour in
stealing from the ﬁelds once the crop was ripe. How to bend
over the headman’s hand and pretend to kiss it, how to beat
his wife and make her bite the dust each night.
Every Friday morning he would put on a clean galabeya
and head for the mosque to attend the weekly prayer. The
prayer over, I would see him walking with the other men like
himself as they commented on the Friday sermon, on how
convincing and eloquent the imam had been to a degree
that he had surpassed the unsurpassable. For was it not
verily true that stealing was a sin, and killing was a sin, and
defaming the honour of a woman was a sin, and injustice
was a sin, and beating another human being was a sin…?
Moreover, who could deny that to be obedient was a duty,
and to love one’s country too. That love of the ruler and love
of Allah were one and indivisible. Allah protect our ruler for
many long years and may he remain a source of inspiration
and strength to our country, the Arab Nation and all
Mankind.
I could see them walking through the narrow winding
lanes, nodding their heads in admiration, and in approval of
everything his Holiness the Imam had said. I would watch
them as they continued to nod their heads, rub their hands
one against the other, wipe their brows while all the time
invoking Allah’s name, calling upon his blessings, repeating
His holy words in a guttural, subdued tone, muttering and
whispering without a moment’s respite.
On my head I carried a heavy earthenware jar, full of
water. Under its weight my neck would sometimes jerk
backwards, or to the left or to the right. I had to exert myself
to maintain it balanced on my head, and keep it from falling.
I kept my legs moving in the way my mother had taught me,
so that my neck remained upright. I was still young at the
time, and my breasts were not yet rounded. I knew nothing
about men. But I could hear them as they invoked Allah’s
name and called upon His blessings, or repeated His holy
words in a subdued guttural tone. I would observe them
nodding their heads, or rubbing their hands one against the
other, or coughing, or clearing their throats with a rasping
noise, or constantly scratching under the armpits and
between the thighs. I saw them as they watched what went
on around them with wary, doubting, stealthy eyes, eyes
ready to pounce, full of an aggressiveness that seemed
strangely servile.
Sometimes I could not distinguish which one of them was
my father. He resembled them so closely that it was diﬃcult
to tell. So one day I asked my mother about him. How was it
that she had given birth to me without a father? First she
beat me. Then she brought a woman who was carrying a
small knife or maybe a razor blade. They cut oﬀ a piece of
ﬂesh from between my thighs.
I cried all night. Next morning my mother did not send me
to the ﬁelds. She usually made me carry a load of manure
on my head and take it to the ﬁelds. I preferred to go to the
ﬁelds rather than stay in our hut. There, I could play with
the goats, climb over the water-wheel, and swim with the
boys in the stream. A little boy called Mohammadain used to
pinch me under water and follow me into the small shelter
made of maize stalks. He would make me lie down beneath
a pile of straw, and lift up my galabeya. We played at ‘bride
and bridegroom’. From some part in my body, where exactly
I did not know, would come a sensation of sharp pleasure.
Later I would close my eyes and feel with my hand for the
exact spot. The moment I touched it, I would realize that I
had felt the sensation before. Then we would start to play
again until the sun went down, and we could hear his
father’s voice calling to him from the neighbouring ﬁeld. I
would try to hold him back, but he would run oﬀ, promising
to come the next day.
But my mother no longer sent me to the ﬁelds. Before the
sun had started to appear in the sky, she would nudge me in
the shoulder with her ﬁst so that I would awaken, pick up
the earthenware jar and go oﬀ to ﬁll it with water. Once
back, I would sweep under the animals and then make rows
of dung cakes which I left in the sun to dry. On baking day I
would knead dough and make bread.
To knead the dough I squatted on the ground with the
trough between my legs. At regular intervals I lifted the
elastic mass up into the air and let it fall back into the
trough. The heat of the oven was full on my face, singeing
the edges of my hair. My galabeya often slipped up my
thighs, but I paid no attention until the moment when I
would glimpse my uncle’s hand moving slowly from behind
the book he was reading to touch my leg. The next moment
I could feel it travelling up my thigh with a cautious,
stealthy, trembling movement. Every time there was the
sound of a footstep at the entrance to our house, his hand
would withdraw quickly. But whenever everything around us
lapsed into silence, broken only every now and then by the
snap of dry twigs between my ﬁngers as I fed the oven, and
the sound of his regular breathing reaching me from behind
the book so that I could not tell whether he was snoring
quietly in his sleep or wide awake and panting, his hand
would continue to press against my thigh with a grasping,
almost brutal insistence.
He was doing to me what Mohammadain had done to me
before. In fact, he was doing even more, but I no longer felt
the strong sensation of pleasure that radiated from an
unknown and yet familiar part of my body. I closed my eyes
and tried to reach the pleasure I had known before but in
vain. It was as if I could no longer recall the exact spot from
which it used to arise, or as though a part of me, of my
being, was gone and would never return.
* * *
My uncle was not young. He was much older than I was. He
used to travel to Cairo alone, attend classes in El Azhar, and
study at a time when I was still a child and had not yet
learned to read or write. My uncle would put a chalk pencil
between my ﬁngers and make me write on a slate: Alif, Ba,
Gim, Dal… Sometimes he made me repeat after him: ‘Alif
has nothing on her, Ba’s got one dot underneath, Gim’s got
a dot in the middle, Dal has nothing at all.’ He would nod his
head as he recited from the thousand-verse poem of Ibn
Malik, just as though he was reciting from the Koran, and I
would repeat each letter after him, and nod my head in the
same way.
Once the holidays were over, my uncle would climb on the
back of the donkey, and set oﬀ for the Delta Railway
Station. I followed close behind carrying his big basket,
packed full of eggs, cheese and bread cakes, topped with
his books and clothes. All along the way, until we got to the
station, my uncle would not cease talking to me about his
room at the end of Mohammad Ali Street near the Citadel,
about El Azhar, Ataba Square, the trams, the people who
lived in Cairo. At moments he would sing in a sweet voice,
his body swaying rhythmically with the movement of the
donkey.
I abandoned ye not on the high seas
Yet on the dry land thou hast left me.
I bartered thee not for shining gold
Yet for worthless straw thou didst sell me
O my long night
O mine eyes. Oh.
When my uncle would clamber into the train, and bid me
farewell, I would cry and beg him to take me with him to
Cairo. But my uncle would ask,
‘What will you do in Cairo, Firdaus?’
And I would reply: ‘I will go to El Azhar and study like you.’
Then he would laugh and explain that El Azhar was only
for men. And I would cry, and hold on to his hand, as the
train started to move. But he would pull it away with a force
and suddenness that made me fall ﬂat on my face.
So I would retrace my steps with bent head, pondering the
shape of my toes, as I walked along the country road,
wondering about myself, as the questions went round in my
mind. Who was I? Who was my father? Was I going to spend
my life sweeping the dung out from under the animals,
carrying manure on my head, kneading dough, and baking
bread?
Back in my father’s house I stared at the mud walls like a
stranger who had never entered it before. I looked around
almost in surprise, as though I had not been born here, but
had suddenly dropped from the skies, or emerged from
somewhere deep down in the earth, to ﬁnd myself in a place
where I did not belong, in a home which was not mine, born
from a father who was not my father, and from a mother
who was not my mother. Was it my uncle’s talk of Cairo, and
the people who lived there that had changed me? Was I
really the daughter of my mother, or was my mother
someone else? Or was I born the daughter of my mother
and later changed into someone else? Or had my mother
been transformed into another woman who resembled her
so closely that I could not tell the diﬀerence?
I tried to recall what my mother had looked like the ﬁrst
time I saw her. I can remember two eyes. I can remember
her eyes in particular. I cannot describe their colour, or their
shape. They were eyes that I watched. They were eyes that
watched me. Even if I disappeared from their view, they
could see me, and follow me wherever I went, so that if I
faltered while learning to walk they would hold me up.
Every time I tried to walk, I fell. A force seemed to push
me from behind, so that I fell forwards, or a weight from in
front seemed to lean on me so that I fell backwards. It was
something like a pressure of the air wanting to crush me;
something like the pull of the earth trying to suck me down
into its depths. And in the midst of it all there I was,
struggling, straining my arms and legs in an attempt to
stand up. But I kept falling, buﬀeted by the contradictory
forces that kept pulling me in diﬀerent directions, like an
object thrown into a limitless sea, without shores and
without a bed, slashed by the waters when it starts to sink,
and by the wind if it starts to ﬂoat. Forever sinking and
rising, sinking and rising between the sea and the sky, with
nothing to hold on to except the two eyes. Two eyes to
which I clung with all my might. Two eyes that alone seemed
to hold me up. To this very moment I do not know whether
they were wide or narrow, nor can I recall if they were
surrounded by lashes or not. All I can remember are two
rings of intense white around two circles of intense black. I
only had to look into them for the white to become whiter
and the black even blacker, as though sunlight was pouring
into them from some magical source neither on earth, nor in
the sky, for the earth was pitch black, and the sky dark as
night, with no sun and no moon.
I could tell she was my mother, how I do not know. So I
crawled up to her seeking warmth from her body. Our hut
was cold, yet in winter my father used to shift my straw mat
and my pillow to the small room facing north, and occupy
my corner in the oven room. And instead of staying by my
side to keep me warm, my mother used to abandon me
alone and go to my father to keep him warm. In summer I
would see her sitting at his feet with a tin mug in her hand
as she washed his legs with cold water.
When I grew a little older my father put the mug in my
hand and taught me how to wash his legs with water. I had
now replaced my mother and did the things she used to do.
My mother was no longer there, but instead there was
another woman who hit me on my hand and took the mug
away from me. My father told me she was my mother. In
fact, she looked exactly like my mother; the same long
garments, the same face, and the same way of moving. But
when I used to look into her eyes I could feel she was not
my mother. They were not the eyes that held me up each
time I was on the point of falling. They were not two rings of
pure white surrounding two circles of intense black, where
the white would become even whiter, and the black even
blacker every time I looked into them, as though the light of
the sun or the moon kept ﬂowing through them.
No light seemed ever to touch the eyes of this woman,
even when the day was radiant and the sun at its very
brightest. One day I took her head between my hands and
turned it so that the sun fell directly on her face, but her
eyes remained dull, impervious to its light, like two
extinguished lamps. I stayed awake all night weeping alone,
trying to muﬄe my sobs so that they would not disturb my
little brothers and sisters sleeping on the ﬂoor beside me.
For, like most people, I had many brothers and sisters. They
were like chicks that multiply in spring, shiver in winter and
lose their feathers, and then in summer are stricken with
diarrhoea, waste away quickly and one by one creep into a
corner and die.
* * *
When one of his female children died, my father would eat
his supper, my mother would wash his legs, and then he
would go to sleep, just as he did every night. When the child
that died was a boy, he would beat my mother, then have
his supper and lie down to sleep.
My father never went to bed without supper, no matter
what happened. Sometimes when there was no food at
home we would all go to bed with empty stomachs. But he
would never fail to have a meal. My mother would hide his
food from us at the bottom of one of the holes in the oven.
He would sit eating alone while we watched him. One
evening I dared to stretch out my hand to his plate, but he
struck me a sharp blow over the back of my ﬁngers.
I was so hungry that I could not cry. I sat in front of him
watching as he ate, my eyes following his hand from the
moment his ﬁngers plunged into the bowl until it rose into
the air, and carried the food into his mouth. His mouth was
like that of a camel, with a big opening and wide jaws. His
upper jaw kept clamping down on his lower jaw with a loud
grinding noise, and chewed through each morsel so
thoroughly that we could hear his teeth striking against
each other. His tongue kept rolling round and round in his
mouth as though it also was chewing, darting out every now
and then to lick oﬀ some particle of food that had stuck to
his lips, or dropped on his chin.
At the end of his meal my mother would bring him a glass
of water. He drank it, then belched loudly, expelling the air
from the mouth or belly with a prolonged noise. After that
he smoked his water pipe, ﬁlling the room around him with
thick clouds of smoke, coughing, snorting and inhaling
deeply through his mouth and nose. Once over with his pipe
he lay down, and a moment later the hut would resonate
with his loud snoring.
I sensed he was not my father. Nobody told me, and I was
not really aware of the fact. I could just feel it deep down
inside me. I did not whisper the secret to anyone but kept it
to myself. Every time my uncle came back for the summer
holidays, I would hang on to his galabeya when the time
came for him to leave, and ask that he take me with him.
My uncle was closer to me than my father. He was not so
old, and he allowed me to sit beside him and look at his
books. He taught me the alphabet, and after my father died
he sent me to elementary school. Later, when my mother
died, he took me with him to Cairo.
* * *
I sometimes wonder whether a person can be born twice.
When I entered my uncle’s dwelling, I put my hand on a
switch and light ﬂooded the room. I shut my eyes against
the glare and screamed. When I opened my lids again I had
the feeling of looking out through them for the ﬁrst time, as
though I had just come into the world, or was being born a
second time, since I knew that I had in fact been born some
years before. I glimpsed myself in the mirror. This also had
never happened to me before. At ﬁrst I did not know that it
was a mirror. I was frightened when I found myself looking
at a little girl wearing a dress that reached down no further
than her knees, and a pair of shoes that hid her feet. I
looked round the room. There was no one else in it apart
from me. I could not understand where this girl had sprung
from, nor realize that she could only be me. For I was always
dressed in a long galabeya which trailed along the ground,
and no matter where I went it was always barefoot. But I
recognized my face immediately. Yet how could I be so sure
it was my face since I had not seen myself in a mirror
before? The room was empty, and the wardrobe mirror was
right in front of me. This girl standing upright in it could only
be me. The dress and the shoes had been bought by my
uncle for me to wear in school.
I stood in front of the mirror staring at my face. Who am I?
Firdaus, that is how they call me. The big round nose I got
from my father, and the thin-lipped mouth from my mother.
A sinking feeling went through my body. I neither liked the
look of my nose, nor the shape of my mouth. I thought my
father had died, yet here he was alive in the big, ugly,
rounded nose. My mother, too, was dead, but continued to
live in the form of this thin-lipped mouth. And here I was
unchanged, the same Firdaus, but now clad in a dress, and
with shoes on her feet.
I was ﬁlled with a deep hatred for the mirror. From that
moment I never looked into it again. Even when I stood in
front of it, I was not seeing myself but only combing my
hair, or wiping my face, or adjusting the collar of my dress.
Then I would pick up my satchel and race oﬀ to school.
* * *
I loved school. It was full of boys and girls. We played in the
courtyard, gasping for breath as we ran from one end of it to
the other, or sat splitting sunﬂower seeds between our teeth
in rapid succession, or chewed gum with a loud smacking
noise, or bought molass sugar sticks and dry carob, or drank
liquorice and tamarind and sugar cane juice; in other words,
we went for everything with a deliciously strong ﬂavour.
Once back I would sweep and clean the house, wash my
uncle’s clothes, make his bed, and tidy his books. He bought
me a heavy iron which I would heat on the kerosene stove,
and use to launder his kaftan and turban.
Shortly before sunset he would return from El Azhar. I
served supper and we ate it together. The meal over, I lay
on my sofa, while my uncle sat on his bed and read out
aloud. I used to jump up to his side on the high bed, curl my
ﬁngers around his large hand with its long, thin ﬁngers and
touch his great big books, with their smooth, closely written
pages, covered in ﬁne black letters. I would try to make out
a few words. They looked to me like mysterious signs that
ﬁlled me with something like fear. El Azhar was an awesome
world peopled only by men, and my uncle was one of them,
was a man. When he read, his voice resonated with a sacred
awe, and his great long ﬁngers were seized with a strange
trembling which I could feel under my hand. It was familiar,
like a trembling experienced in childhood, a distant dream
still remembered.
During the cold winter nights, I curled up in my uncle’s
arms like a baby in its womb. We drew warmth from our
closeness. My face buried in his arms, I wanted to tell him
that I loved him, but the words would not come. I wanted to
cry but the tears would not ﬂow. And after a while I would
fall into a deep sleep until morning.
One day I fell sick with fever. My uncle sat on the bed by
my side holding my head, patting my face gently with his
great long ﬁngers, and I slept all night holding on to his
hand.
* * *
When I was awarded my primary school certiﬁcate he
bought me a little wristwatch, and that night took me to the
cinema. I saw a woman dancing. Her thighs were naked.
And I saw a man hugging a woman. Then he kissed her on
the lips. I hid my face behind my hand and did not dare to
look at my uncle. Later, he told me that dancing was a sin,
and that kissing a man, too, was a sin, but now I could no
longer look into his eyes. That night when we returned
home I did not sit beside him on the bed as I often used to
do before, but hid myself under the eiderdown on my little
sofa.
I was trembling all over, seized with a feeling I could not
explain, that my uncle’s great long ﬁngers would draw close
to me after a little while, and cautiously lift the eiderdown
under which I lay. Then his lips would touch my face and
press down on my mouth, and his trembling ﬁngers would
feel their way slowly upwards over my thighs.
A strange thing was happening to me, strange because it
had never happened to me before, or because it had been
happening to me all the time, ever since I could remember.
Somewhere, in some distant spot within my body was
awakening an old pleasure lost a long time ago, or a new
pleasure still unknown, and indeﬁnable, for it seemed to
arise outside my body, or in a part of my being severed from
it many years ago.
* * *
My uncle started to go out a lot. When I woke up in the
morning he would be gone, and when he came back at night
I would be in bed, fast asleep. If I brought him a glass of
water, or a plate of food, he would stretch out his hand, and
take it, without looking at me. When I hid my head under
the eiderdown, I would listen intently for the sound of his
footsteps. I held my breath and pretended to be asleep,
waiting for his ﬁngers to reach out for me. An eternity
seemed to pass without anything happening. I could hear
his bed creak as he lay down, followed after some time by
the sound of his regular snoring. Then, only, was I assured
that he had fallen asleep.
He became a diﬀerent man. He no longer read before
going to sleep, or wore his jebbah and kaftan. Instead he
bought a suit and tie, found a post in the Ministry of Wakfs,
and married the daughter of his teacher at El Azhar.
He sent me to secondary school, and took me with him to
his new house, where I lived with him and his wife. His wife
was a short, fat woman with a fair complexion. Her sluggish
body swayed from side to side when she walked, with the
waddling movement of a well-fed duck. Her voice was soft
not with gentleness, but with the softness born of cruelty.
Her eyes were large, and black with an extinguished vitality
that left nothing but pools of dark, sleepy indiﬀerence.
She never washed my uncle’s feet, and he never beat her,
or spoke to her in a loud voice. He was extremely polite, but
treated her with the peculiar kind of courtesy devoid of true
respect which men preserve for women. I sensed that his
feeling for her was more one of fear than of love, and that
she came from a higher social class than his. When her
father, or one of her relatives paid us a visit my uncle would
buy meat or chicken, and the house would resonate with his
laughter. But when his aunt arrived, dressed in her ﬂowing
peasant garments, her cracked hands showing through the
openings of her long sleeves, he retreated into a corner
without a word or even a smile.
His aunt would sit next to me on the bed weeping silently,
and mentioning how she regretted having sold her golden
necklace in order to pay for his studies in El Azhar. In the
morning she would empty her basket of the chicken, eggs
and breadcakes it contained, hook it over her arm, and
leave. I would say to her,
‘Stay just another day with us, Grandma,’ but my uncle
never said a word, and neither did his wife.
I went to school every day. Once back I swept the house
and washed the ﬂoor, the dishes and the clothes. My uncle’s
wife only did the cooking, leaving the pots and pans for me
to scour and clean. Later, my uncle brought home a small
servant girl who slept in my room. The bed was reserved for
me, so she slept on the ﬂoor. On a cold night I told her to
come and sleep with me in the bed, but when my uncle’s
wife entered the room and saw us, she beat her. Then she
beat me also.
* * *
One day when I returned from school, I found my uncle
looking very angry with me. His wife also seemed to share
his anger, and she continued to appear angry, until he
decided to take me away from the house with my clothes
and books, and put me in the boarding girls section of the
school. From then on I slept there at night. At the end of
each week, the fathers, mothers and other relatives of the
girls visited them, or took them oﬀ to spend Thursday and
Friday at home. I would look over the top of the high wall
and watch them as they departed, my eyes following the
people and the movement of the street like a prisoner
condemned to look out at life over the top of a high prison
wall.
But I came to love school despite everything. There were
new books, and new subjects, and girls of my age with
whom I used to study. We talked to one another about our
lives, exchanged secrets, and revealed our depths to one
another. There was nobody to upset things for us except the
superintendent who walked around the boarding house on
tiptoe, spying on us day and night, listening to what we had
to say. Even when we slept she kept a vigilant eye on our
every movement, followed us as we dreamed. If one of us so
much as sighed, or emitted a sound, or made the slightest
movement in her dream, she would pounce on her like a
bird of prey.
I had a friend called Wafeya. Her bed was next to mine. I
would move my bed close up to hers after the lights went
out, and we would talk until midnight. She spoke of a cousin
with whom she was in love, and who in turn loved her, and I
spoke of my hopes for the future. There was nothing in my
past, or in my childhood, to talk about, and no love or
anything of the sort in the present. If I had something to
say, therefore, it could only concern the future. For the
future was still mine to paint in the colours I desired. Still
mine to decide about freely, and change as I saw ﬁt.
Sometimes I imagined that I would become a doctor, or an
engineer, or a lawyer, or a judge. And one day the whole
school went out on the streets to join a big demonstration
against the government. Suddenly I found myself riding high
up on the shoulders of the girls shouting, ‘Down with the
government!’
When I got back to school my voice was hoarse, my hair in
disarray, and my clothes were torn in several places, but all
through the night I kept imagining myself as a great leader
or head of state.
I knew that women did not become heads of state, but I
felt that I was not like other women, nor like the other girls
around me who kept talking about love, or about men. For
these were subjects I never mentioned. Somehow I was not
interested in the things that occupied their minds, and what
seemed of importance to them struck me as being trivial.
One night, Wafeya asked me: ‘Have you ever fallen in
love, Firdaus?’
‘No, Wafeya. I have never been in love,’ I replied.
She stared at me with surprise and said, ‘How strange!’
‘Why do you ﬁnd it strange?’ I asked.
‘There is something about your looks that suggests you
are in love.’
‘But what is it in a person’s looks that can hint at love?’
She shook her head and said, ‘I do not know. But I feel
that you, in particular, are a person who cannot live without
love.’
‘Yet I am living without love.’
‘Then you are either living a lie, or not living at all.’
She pronounced the last word and then immediately
dropped fast asleep. My eyes remained wide open, staring
into the darkness. Slowly, distant, half-forgotten images
started to emerge from the night. I saw Mohammadain lying
on a bed of straw under the open shelter. The smell of the
straw crept up my nose, and the touch of his ﬁngers moved
over my body. My whole body shuddered with a faraway yet
familiar pleasure arising from some unknown source, from
some indeﬁnable spot outside my being. And yet I could feel
it somewhere in my body, a gentle pulsation beginning like
a tender pleasure, and ending like a tender pain. Something
I tried to hold on to, to touch if only for a moment, but it
slipped away from me like the air, like an illusion, or a
dream that ﬂoats away and is lost. I wept in my sleep as
though it was something I was losing now; a loss I was
experiencing for the ﬁrst time, and not something I had lost
a long time ago.
The nights at school were long, and the days were even
longer. I would ﬁnish studying my lessons hours before the
last night-bell was rung. So I discovered that the school had
a library. A neglected room in the back yard, with its shelves
falling to pieces, and books covered in a thick layer of dust. I
used to wipe oﬀ the dust with a yellow cloth, sit on a broken
chair under the light of a feeble lamp, and read.
I developed a love of books, for with every book I learned
something new. I got to know about the Persians, the Turks
and the Arabs. I read about the crimes committed by kings
and rulers, about wars, peoples, revolutions, and the lives of
revolutionaries. I read love stories and love poems. But I
preferred books written about rulers. I read about a ruler
whose female servants and concubines were as numerous
as his army, and about another whose only interests in life
were wine, women, and whipping his slaves. A third cared
little for women, but enjoyed wars, killing, and torturing
men. Another of these rulers loved food, money and
hoarding riches without end. Still another was possessed
with such an admiration for himself and his greatness that
for him no one else in the land existed. There was also a
ruler so obsessed with plots and conspiracies that he spent
all his time distorting the facts of history and trying to fool
his people.
I discovered that all these rulers were men. What they had
in common was an avaricious and distorted personality, a
never-ending appetite for money, sex and unlimited power.
They were men who sowed corruption on the earth, and
plundered their peoples, men endowed with loud voices, a
capacity for persuasion, for choosing sweet words and
shooting poisoned arrows. Thus, the truth about them was
revealed only after their deaths, and as a result I discovered
that history tended to repeat itself with a foolish obstinacy.
Newspapers and magazines were delivered to the library
regularly. I got into the habit of reading what was written in
them and looking at the pictures. And so, quite often, I
would stumble on the picture of one or other of these rulers
as he sat with the congregation attending Friday morning
prayers. There he sat opening and closing his lids, looking
out through them with an expression of great humility, like a
man stricken to his depths. I could see he was trying to
deceive Allah in the same way as he deceived the people.
Around him were gathered members of his retinue, nodding
their heads in agreement and with admiration for everything
that was being said, invoking Allah’s blessings and his
eternal majesty in subdued guttural tones, rubbing their
hands one against the other, observing what went on
around them with wary, doubting, stealthy eyes, ready to
pounce, full of an aggressiveness that touched on the
servile.
I could see them as they prayed ardently for the souls of
the nation’s martyrs who had lost their lives as a result of
war, famine or pestilence. I would follow the heads going
down, and the buttocks coming up, fat rounded buttocks
swollen with ﬂesh and fear. When they pronounced the word
‘patriotism’ I could tell at once that in their heart of hearts
they feared not Allah, and that at the back of their minds
patriotism meant that the poor should die to defend the
land of the rich, their land, for I knew that the poor had no
land.
When I became bored with reading history, which seemed
unchanging, bored with the same old stories, the same
pictures which all looked the same, I would go down to sit in
the playground all alone. Often, the night would be dark,
without a moon shedding its light from above, the last bell
would have pealed out its last note a long while ago, leaving
a deep silence behind. Around me, all the windows would be
shut, and all the lights would be out, yet I would continue to
sit in the dark alone, and wonder about many things. What
will become of me in the coming years? Will I go to the
university? Would my uncle agree to send me there for my
studies?
One night a teacher saw me as I sat there. For a moment
she was frightened by the sight of a mass that did not
move, yet looked like a human shape sitting in the dark.
Before coming nearer to me she called out:
‘Who is sitting there?’
In a weak, scared voice I replied, ‘It’s me, Firdaus.’
When she had drawn nearer she recognized me, and
seemed surprised, for I was one of the best girls in her class,
and the best girls used to go to bed as soon as the night-bell
rang.
I told her I was feeling a little tense and had not been able
to fall asleep, so she sat down next to me. Her name was
Iqbal. She was short, and plump with long black hair and
black eyes. I could see her eyes looking at me, observing
me, despite the darkness. Every time I turned my head,
they were after me, holding on to me, refusing to let me go.
Even when I covered my face with both hands, they seemed
to see through them into my eyes.
Without warning, I burst into tears. The tears ran down my
face behind my hands. She took hold of both my hands and
lifted them away from my face. I heard her say:
‘Firdaus, Firdaus, please do not cry.’
‘Let me cry,’ I said.
‘I’ve never seen you cry before. What’s happened to you?’
‘Nothing, nothing at all.’
‘Impossible. Something must have happened.’
‘No, nothing has happened, Miss Iqbal.’
There was a note of surprise in her voice. ‘Are you crying
for no reason at all?’
‘I do not know what the reason is. Nothing new has
happened to me.’
She remained by my side, seated in silence. I could see
her black eyes wandering into the night, and the tears
welling up in them with a glistening light. She tightened her
lips and swallowed hard and suddenly the light in her eyes
went out. Again and again they started to shine and after a
moment went out, like ﬂames snuﬀed out in the night. But
the moment came when she tightened her lips and
swallowed hard, but in vain, for two tears stayed behind in
her eyes. I saw them drop on to her nose and slowly trickle
down each side. She hid her face with one hand, pulled out
a handkerchief with the other and dabbed her nose.
‘Are you crying, Miss Iqbal?’ I asked.
‘No,’ she said, then hid her handkerchief, swallowed hard,
and smiled at me.
The night around us was deep, silent, motionless, with not
a single sound or movement anywhere. Everything was
steeped in an absolute darkness through which no ray of
light penetrated, for in the sky was neither moon nor sun.
My face was turned towards her, and my eyes looked into
her eyes: two rings of pure white, surrounding two circles of
intense black that looked out at me. As I continued to gaze
into them, the white seemed to turn even whiter, and the
black even blacker, as though light ﬂowed through them
from some unknown magical source which was neither on
the earth, nor in the heavens, for the earth was enveloped
in the cloak of night, and the heavens had no sun nor moon
to give them light.
I held her eyes in mind, took her hand in mine. The feeling
of our hands touching was strange, sudden. It was a feeling
that made my body tremble with a deep distant pleasure,
more distant than the age of my remembered life, deeper
than the consciousness I had carried with me throughout. I
could feel it somewhere, like a part of my being which had
been born with me when I was born, but had not grown with
me when I had grown, like a part of my being that I had
once known, but left behind when I was born. A cloudy
awareness of something that could have been, and yet was
never lived.
At that moment a memory came to my mind. My lips
opened to speak, but my voice failed to come through, as
though no sooner did I remember than I had already
forgotten. My heart faltered, stiﬂed by a frightened, frenzied
beating over something precious I was on the point of
losing, or had just lost, for ever. My ﬁngers held on to her
hand with such violence that no force on earth, no matter
how great, could tear it away from me.
* * *
After that night, whenever we met, my lips parted to say
something which no sooner remembered was already
forgotten. My heart beat with fear, or with an emotion
resembling fear. I wanted to reach out to her, and take her
hand, but she would enter the classroom and leave it after
the lesson was over without seeming to have noticed my
presence. When she happened to look at me, it was always
in the same way as she looked at any other of her pupils.
In bed, before going to sleep, I used to wonder: ‘Has Miss
Iqbal forgotten?’ A moment later Wafeya would draw her
bed close to mine and ask:
‘Forgotten what?’
‘I don’t know, Wafeya.’
‘You are living in a world of imagination, Firdaus.’
‘Not at all, Wafeya. It did happen, you know.’
‘What happened?’ she enquired.
I tried to explain to her what had happened, but I did not
know how to describe it, or to be more precise I found
nothing to talk about. It was as if something had happened
which I was unable to recall, or as if nothing had happened
at all.
I closed my eyes and tried to bring back the scene. Slowly
there appeared two circles of intense black surrounded by
two rings of pure white. The more I stared into them the
bigger they grew, expanding before my eyes. The black
circle kept growing until it reached the size of the earth, and
the white circle expanded into a piercingly white mass, large
as the sun. My eyes lost themselves in the black and the
white until, blinded by their intensity, they could no longer
perceive either one or the other. The images before my eyes
became confused. I could no longer distinguish between the
faces of my father and my mother, my uncle and
Mohammadain, Iqbal and Wafeya. I opened my eyes wide in
panic as if threatened with blindness. I could see the
outlines of Wafeya’s face in front of me in the darkness. She
was still awake, and I heard her say:
‘Firdaus, are you in love with Miss Iqbal?’
‘Me?’ I said with amazement.
‘Yes, you. Who else then?’
‘Never, Wafeya.’
‘Then why do you talk about her every night?’
‘Me? Talk about her? That’s not true. You always
exaggerate, Wafeya.’
‘Miss Iqbal is an excellent teacher,’ she commented.
‘Yes,’ I agreed, ‘but she’s a woman. How could I be in love
with a woman?’
There were only a few days left to the ﬁnal examination.
Wafeya no longer talked to me about her sweetheart, and
the night-bell no longer rang as early as before. Every night
I would sit up late in the study room with Wafeya and the
other girls. Now and then the superintendent of the
boarding house would walk in to inspect the way we
studied, just as she used to walk around and inspect the
way we slept or even dreamt. For if one of the girls so much
as lifted her head to take a breath, or rest her neck, she
would appear suddenly out of nowhere, and the girl would
immediately bend her head over the book again.
I liked classes, and I enjoyed studying, despite the
unfailing vigilance of the superintendent, and other things.
When the results of the ﬁnal examination were announced, I
was told that I had come out second in the school and
seventh countrywide. On the night when the certiﬁcates
were distributed, a special ceremony was held for the
occasion. The Principal called out my name in the big hall
crowded with hundreds of mothers, fathers, and other
relatives of the girls, but no one stepped up to take the
certiﬁcate. A sudden silence descended on the hall. The
Principal called out my name a second time. I tried to stand
up but my legs failed me. I called out from my seat,
‘Present.’
I saw all heads turn towards me, and all eyes staring in
my direction, countless eyes transformed under my gaze
into innumerable rings of white surrounding innumerable
circles of black, which turned in a concerted circular
movement to ﬁx their look steadily in my eyes.
The Principal called out in a commanding voice: ‘Don’t
reply while seated. Stand up!’
I realized that I was on my feet when the white rings and
the black circles moved upwards in unison to fasten
themselves once more on my eyes.
The Principal called out again in a loud voice that echoed
in my ears louder than any voice I had ever heard in my life
before, ‘Where is your guardian?’
A heavy silence descended on the hall, a silence which
seemed to possess a resonance of its own. The air vibrated
with a peculiar sound, and the breathing of many chests had
a rhythmic tone which reached me at the back of the
crowded hall. The heads swung back to their normal
position, and there I stood contemplating line upon line of
backs sitting upright in their rows.
Two eyes – two eyes alone fastened themselves upon
mine. No matter how far I shifted my gaze, or how much I
moved my head, they followed me closely, tightened their
hold. Everything was now enveloped in a growing darkness
in which I could no longer discern the slightest glimmer of
light, except for two jet black eyes encircled by two rings of
dazzling white. The more I gazed into them the more
intense the black and the white became, as though imbued
with light from some magic source, for the hall was
enveloped in total darkness, and the night outside was like
liquid coal.
It seemed to me as though I reached out in the dark and
took her hand, or that she reached out in the dark and took
my hand. The sudden contact made my body shiver with a
pain so deep that it was almost like pleasure, or a pleasure
so deep that it bordered on pain. It was a remote pleasure,
buried in such faraway depths that it seemed to have arisen
a very long time ago, longer than the length of memory,
older than the remembered years of life’s journey.
Something no sooner remembered than forgotten, as if it
had happened just once before, only to be lost for all time,
or as though it had never happened at all.
I parted my lips ready to tell her all, but she said,
‘Don’t say anything, Firdaus.’
She led me by the hand, through row upon row of people,
until we mounted the platform where the Principal was
standing. She took my certiﬁcate, then signed her name to
acknowledge that she had also been given my certiﬁcate of
merit. The Principal read out the marks I had received in
each subject, and I heard a clatter in the hall that resembled
applause. The Principal held out her hand with a box
wrapped in coloured paper and tied with a silken green
ribbon. I tried to stretch out my arm but it failed to move.
Once more I glimpsed Miss Iqbal approaching the Principal.
She took the package from her hand, then led me back
through the rows of people to where I was sitting before. I
sat down, put the certiﬁcate on my lap, and placed the box
on top of it.
* * *
The school year had come to an end. Fathers and guardians
arrived to take the girls home. The Principal sent a telegram
to my uncle and a few days later he arrived at the school to
take me away. I had not seen Miss Iqbal since the night of
the ceremony. That same night when the ‘lights out’ bell
rang I was unable to sleep. I slipped down to the courtyard
and sat there in the dark by myself. Each time I heard a
sound coming from some distance away, or felt some
movement, I looked around me. At one moment I saw a
shape about the size of a person moving near the entrance.
I leapt to my feet. My heart beat wildly and the blood rushed
to my head. It seemed to me that the shape I had seen was
moving towards me. I rose and walked to meet it slowly. As I
advanced I realized that my whole body was bathed in
sweat, including the roots of my hair and the palms of my
hands. I was alone in the darkness and a slight shiver of fear
went through me. I called out, ‘Miss Iqbal,’ but all I managed
was a mere whisper that failed even to reach my ears. I
could hear nothing and my fear increased. But still there
was a shape the size of a human body, looming in the dark.
I spoke out in a loud voice which reached my ears clearly
this time.
‘Who is there?’
My own voice awakened me from what appeared to be a
dream, like a person talking out loud in his sleep. The
darkness seemed to lift slightly revealing a low unplastered
brick wall about the height of an average person. It was a
wall which I had seen before, yet for a brief moment I felt as
though it had been built that instant.
Before leaving school for the last time, I kept looking
around me, sweeping walls, windows, doors with my eyes
unceasingly, expecting something to open suddenly and
reveal her eyes, as they looked out at me for a moment, or
her hand waving a usual farewell. I searched on frantically,
without respite. At every moment I kept losing hope, only to
regain it an instant later. My eyes shifted restlessly up and
down, to and fro. My chest was heaving with a deep
emotion. Before we passed through the outer gate I gasped
to my uncle:
‘Please wait for me just one more minute.’
The next instant I was following him into the street, and
the door had already closed behind us. But I continued to
turn round and look back at it for quite a while as if it was
about to swing open again, or as though I had a feeling of
certainty that someone was standing behind it and getting
ready to push it open at any moment.
* * *
I walked with heavy steps behind my uncle, carrying the
image of that closed door engraved in my mind. When I ate
my meals, or drank, or lay down to sleep it was there in
front of me. I knew that I was now back in my uncle’s house.
The woman who lived with him was his wife, and the
children who ran around the house were their children.
There was no place for me in this house except on the sofa,
a small wooden couch placed in the dining room close up
against the thin wall which separated it from the bedroom.
And so every night I could hear their subdued voices
whispering on the other side of the partition.
‘It’s not easy to ﬁnd work these days when all you have is
a secondary school certiﬁcate.’
‘What can she do then?’
‘Nothing. These secondary schools don’t teach them
anything. I should have sent her to a commercial training
school.’
‘It’s no use talking of what you should have done. What
are you going to do now?’
‘She can stay with us until I ﬁnd her a job.’
‘That could be for years. The house is small and life is
expensive. She eats twice as much as any of our children.’
‘She helps you with the house and the children.’
‘We have the servant girl, and I cook. We don’t need her.’
‘But she can make the work easier for you by helping with
the cooking.’
‘I don’t like her cooking. You know, your holiness, cooking
is the “spirit you breathe” into it. And I do not like what she
“breathes” into her cooking, and neither do you. Don’t you
remember the okra she cooked for us? You told me it was
not the okra you are accustomed to eat when I make it with
my own hands.’
‘If you keep her instead of Saadia, we’ll save the girl’s
wages.’
‘She will not be able to replace Saadia. Saadia is light and
quick, and puts her heart into her work. In addition, she’s
not too fond of food, or of sleeping long hours. But this girl’s
every movement is slow and heavy. She’s cold-blooded and
couldn’t care less.’
‘So what do we do with her then?’
‘We can be rid of her by sending her to the university.
There she can live in the quarters allocated to the girl
students.’
‘To the university? To a place where she will be sitting side
by side with men? A respected Sheikh and man of religion
like myself sending his niece oﬀ to mix in the company of
men?! Besides, where will the money come from for her
lodging, and books, and clothes? You know how high the
cost of living is these days. Prices seem to have gone mad,
and yet the salary of us government oﬃcials only rises by a
few millimes.’
‘Your holiness, I have a wonderful idea.’
‘What is it?’
‘My uncle, Sheikh Mahmoud, is a virtuous man. He has a
big pension and no children, and he’s been on his own since
his wife died last year. If he marries Firdaus she will have a
good life with him, and he can ﬁnd in her an obedient wife,
who will serve him and relieve his loneliness. Firdaus has
grown, your holiness, and must be married. It is risky for her
to continue without a husband. She is a good girl but the
world is full of bastards.’
‘I agree with you, but Sheikh Mahmoud is much too old for
her.’
‘Who said he is old! He only went on pension this year,
and Firdaus herself is not that young. Girls of her age have
already married years ago and borne children. An old but
reliable man is surely better than a young man who treats
her in a humiliating way, or beats her. You know how young
men are these days.’
‘I agree with you. But you must not forget the very
obvious deformity he has on his face.’
‘Deformity? Who says it’s a deformity? Besides, your
holiness, as the saying goes, “nothing shames a man but an
empty pocket”.’
‘Supposing Firdaus refuses him?’
‘Why should she refuse him? This is her best chance to
get married. Do not forget what a nose she has. It’s big and
ugly like a tin mug. Besides, she has inherited nothing, and
has no income of her own. We will never ﬁnd a better
husband for her than Sheikh Mahmoud.’
‘Do you think Sheikh Mahmoud will welcome the idea?’
‘If I speak to him I am sure he will agree. I intend to ask
him for a big dowry.’
‘How much?’
‘A hundred pounds, or perhaps even two hundred if he has
the money.’
‘If he pays a hundred pounds, then Allah will indeed have
been generous to us, and I would not be so greedy as to ask
for more.’
‘I’ll start with two hundred. You know he’s a man who can
argue for hours over ﬁve millimes, and kill himself over a
piastre.’
‘If he accepts to pay one hundred pounds that will be
suﬃcient blessing from Allah. I will be able to pay my debts
and buy some underwear, as well as a dress or two for
Firdaus. We cannot let her get married in the clothes she’s
wearing.’
‘Anyhow, you won’t have to worry about the bride’s outﬁt,
or furniture and utensils. Sheikh Mahmoud’s house has
everything in it and the furniture his late wife left behind is
good, solid stuﬀ, much better than the rubbish you get
nowadays.’
‘To be sure. What you say is the very truth.’
‘I can swear by Allah, your holiness, that the Lord must
really love this niece of yours, for she will be really fortunate
if Sheikh Mahmoud agrees to marry her.’
‘Do you think he will?’
‘And why should he refuse indeed? Through this marriage
he will become related to a respected Sheikh and man of
religion. Is that not in itself reason enough for him to
welcome such a proposal?’
‘Maybe he’s thinking of taking a woman from a wealthy
family. You know how he worships the piastre.’
‘And does your holiness consider himself a poor man. We
are better oﬀ than a lot of people. Thanks be to Allah for
everything.’
‘Verily, we are full of gratitude to Allah for everything he
has bestowed on us. May He be forever praised and exalted.
Verily our hearts are indeed full of thanks to Allah the
Almighty.’
As I lay there on the couch I heard him kiss his hand twice
in rapid succession as he repeated,
‘Verily our hearts are indeed full of thanks to Allah the
Almighty.’
In my imagination I could almost see him kiss the palm of
his hand, then turn it over to imprint a second kiss on the
back. Through the thin wall, the sucking sound of the two
kisses reached me one after the other, and a moment later
resumed as he moved his lips over to his wife’s hand, or
perhaps her arm or her leg, for I now began to hear her
protesting:
‘No, your holiness, no,’ as she pulled her arm or leg away
from his embrace.
His voice followed, muttering in a subdued, soft tone
almost like a short run of new kisses,
‘No what, you woman?’
The bed creaked under them, and now I could hear their
breathing, irregular, panting, and her voice as she protested
once again:
‘No, your holiness, for the sake of the Prophet. No, this is
sinful.’
Then his stiﬂed tones hissing back:
‘You woman, you… What sin, and what Prophet? I’m your
husband and you’re my wife.’
The bed creaked even more loudly under the two heavy
bodies locked in a struggle, alternately closing in on one
another and separating in a continuous movement, slow
and heavy at ﬁrst, then gradually shifting to a strangely
rapid, almost frenzied rhythm that shook the bed, and the
ﬂoor, and the wall between us and even the sofa on which I
was lying. I felt my body vibrate with the sofa, my breathing
grew more rapid, so that after a while I also started to pant
with the same strange frenzy. Then slowly, as their
movements subsided their respiration grew quiet again, and
I gradually became calmer. My breathing resumed its
normal slow regularity, and I dropped oﬀ to sleep with my
body bathed in a pool of sweat.
* * *
The following morning I made breakfast for my uncle. He
raised his eyes to look at me whenever I brought him a
glass, or a cup of water, but each time I would turn my face
in another direction to avoid his eyes. I waited until he left,
then I kneeled under the wooden couch, pulled out my
shoes, slipped my feet into them and put on my dress. I
opened my small bag, folded my nightgown, packed it
inside, and placed my secondary school certiﬁcate and my
certiﬁcate of merit on top before closing it. My uncle’s wife
was in the kitchen cooking, and Saadia the servant girl was
feeding the children in their room. Hala, the youngest of my
cousins, came in at that moment. Her black eyes opened
wide, staring at my dress, shoes and little bag. She had not
learned to talk yet and could not pronounce the name
Firdaus, so she used to call me ‘Daus’. She was the only one
of the children who smiled at me, and when I was alone in
the room, she would come in and jump on to the couch and
say,
‘Daus, Daus.’
I would stroke her hair and answer, ‘Yes, Hala.’
‘Daus, Daus,’ she would reply, and giggle, and then try to
make me play with her. But her mother’s voice would soon
be heard calling to her from outside, so she would jump oﬀ
the couch, and toddle away on her little legs.
Hala’s eyes were shifting continuously from my shoes, to
my dress, to my little bag and then back. She was holding
on to the hem of my dress, and kept saying:
‘Daus, Daus.’
I whispered in her ear, ‘I’m coming back, Hala.’
But she would not keep quiet. Her ﬁngers held on to my
hand and she continued to repeat, ‘Daus, Daus.’
I gave her a picture of myself to keep her occupied,
opened the door of the ﬂat, stepped out, and closed it
silently behind me. I heard her voice calling out from behind
the door:
‘Daus, Daus.’
My feet ran down the stairs, but her voice continued to
echo in my ears until I reached the bottom, and walked out
into the street. As I advanced over the pavement I could still
hear it coming from somewhere behind me. I turned round,
but could see no one.
I walked down the street just as I had done many times
before, but this time it felt diﬀerent for I did not have any
particular destination. In fact, I had no idea where my steps
were leading me. When I looked at the streets it was as
though I was seeing them for the ﬁrst time. A new world was
opening up in front of my eyes, a world which for me had
not existed before. Maybe it had always been there, always
existed, but I had never seen it, never realized it had been
there all the time. How was it that I had been blind to its
existence all these years? Now it seemed as if a third eye
had suddenly been slit open in my head. I could see crowds
of people moving in an incessant ﬂow through the streets,
some walking on their legs, others riding in buses and cars.
All of them were in a hurry, rushing along, oblivious of what
was happening around them. No one noticed me as I stood
there alone. And because they did not notice me I was able
to observe them well. There were people walking on the
street who wore shabby, torn clothes and downtrodden
shoes. Their faces were pale, their eyes dull, resigned,
weighed down with a certain sadness and worry. But those
who rode in cars had broad, ﬂeshy shoulders, and their
cheeks were full and rounded. From behind the glass
windows they looked out with wary, doubting, stealthy eyes,
eyes preparing to pounce and full of aggression yet
bordering on the strangely servile. I could not distinguish
the faces, or the eyes of those who rode in the buses, only
their heads, and their backs which I could see crowded
against each other, ﬁlling up the whole space of the bus,
overﬂowing on to the steps and the roof. When the bus
came to a stop at the station, or slowed down I could
glimpse the jaundiced faces shining with sweat, and the
bulging eyes expressing a certain fear.
I was amazed by the huge number of people ﬁlling up the
streets everywhere, but even more amazed to see the way
they moved around like blind creatures that could neither
see themselves, nor anyone else. My amazement became
even greater when I suddenly realized that I had become
one of them. This realization ﬁlled me with a sensation that
at ﬁrst had something most pleasurable about it, but quickly
changed like the wonderment of an infant that opens its
eyes for the ﬁrst time to perceive the world around, and yet
the very next moment bursts out screaming as it feels itself
projected into a new environment where it had never been
before.
When night fell I had not yet found a place where I could
spend the long hours until morning. I felt something deep
inside of me screaming with panic. I was now worn out with
fatigue, my stomach racked with hunger. I rested my back
against a wall and stood for a while looking around me. I
could see the wide expanse of street stretched out before
me like the sea. There I was, just a pebble which someone
had tossed into its waters, rolling along with the crowds that
rode in buses and cars, or walked the streets, with unseeing
eyes, incapable of noticing anything or anyone. Each minute
a thousand eyes passed in front of me, but for them I
remained non-existent.
In the dark I suddenly perceived two eyes, or rather felt
them, moving towards me very slowly, closer and closer.
They dropped their gaze with slow intent down to my shoes,
rested there for a moment, then gradually started to climb
up my legs, to my thighs, my belly, my breasts, my neck
and ﬁnally came to a stop, fastening themselves steadily in
my eyes, with the same cold intent.
A shudder passed through my body, like the fear of death,
or like death itself. I tensed the muscles in my back and face
to stay the shiver and overcome this feeling of terror which
had swept my whole being. For after all, I was not
confronted with a hand holding a knife or a razor, but only
with two eyes, nothing but two eyes. I swallowed with an
eﬀort, and thrust one leg forward. I was able to move my
body a few steps away from the eyes, but I felt them on my
back, boring through me from behind. I noticed a small shop
lit up by a glaring light, and hastened my pace towards it. I
stepped inside and hid amidst the little crowd. A few
moments later I came out and looked up and down the
street cautiously. When I was sure the eyes had gone, I ran
quickly down the pavement. Now I had but one thought in
my mind. How to reach my uncle’s house in the shortest
possible time.
* * *
Once back I do not know how I put up with life in my uncle’s
house, nor do I remember how I became Sheikh Mahmoud’s
wife. All I know is that anything I would have to face in the
world had become less frightening than the vision of those
two eyes, which sent a cold shiver running through my spine
whenever I remembered them. I had no idea what colour
they were, green or black, or something else. Nor could I
recall their shape, whether they were large, wide-open eyes,
or just two narrow slits. But whenever I walked in the street,
whether by day or by night, I would look around me
carefully as though I expected the two eyes to rise up
suddenly through some opening in the ground and confront
me.
The day came when I departed from my uncle’s house and
went to live with Sheikh Mahmoud. Now I slept on a
comfortable bed instead of the wooden couch. But no
sooner did I stretch out my body on it to rest from the
fatigue of cooking, and washing and cleaning the large
house with its rooms full of furniture, than Sheikh Mahmoud
would appear by my side. He was already over sixty,
whereas I had not yet turned nineteen. On his chin, below
the lip, was a large swelling, with a hole in the middle. Some
days the hole would be dry, but on others it would turn into
a rusty old tap exuding drops red in colour like blood, or
whitish yellow, like pus.
When the hole dried up, I let him kiss me. I could feel the
swelling on my face and lips like a small purse, or a water
skin, full of a stagnant greasy ﬂuid. But on days when it was
not dry I would turn my lips and face away to avoid the
odour of dead dogs which emanated from it.
At night he would wind his legs and arms around me, and
let his old, gnarled hand travel all over my body, like the
claws of a starving man who has been deprived of real food
for many years wipe the bowl of food clean, and leave not a
single crumb behind.
He lacked the ability to eat much. The swelling on his face
interfered with the movement of his jaws, and his shrivelled
old man’s stomach was upset by too much food. Although
he could only eat small amounts, yet each time he would
wipe his plate clean, sweeping the piece of bread held
between his ﬁngers round and round to make sure nothing
was left. He kept looking at my plate while I ate, and if I left
anything over he picked it up, put it in his mouth and after
swallowing, quickly told me oﬀ for my wastefulness. Yet I
was not given to wasting anything, and the only morsels I
left on the plate were the scanty remains which stuck to its
surface, and could only be removed with soap and water.
When his arms and legs let go of me, I would gently slip
my body out from under him, and go on tiptoe to the
bathroom. There I would carefully wash my face and lips,
my arms and thighs, and every part of my body, taking care
not to miss a single inch, going over it several times with
soap and water.
He had retired from his job, was without work, and without
friends. He never went out of the house, or sat at a coﬀee-
house, lest he be obliged to pay a few piastres for a cup of
coﬀee. All day long he remained by my side in the house, or
in the kitchen, watching me as I cooked or washed. If I
dropped the packet of soap powder and spilled a few grains
on the ﬂoor, he would jump up from his chair and complain
at me for being careless. And if I pressed a little more ﬁrmly
than usual on the spoon as I took ghee out of the tin for
cooking, he would scream out in anger, and draw my
attention to the fact that its contents were diminishing
much more rapidly than they should. When the dustman
came to empty the refuse from the bin, he would go through
it carefully before putting it out on the landing. One day he
discovered some leftover scraps of food, and started yelling
at me so loudly that all the neighbours could hear. After this
incident, he got into the habit of beating me whether he had
a reason for it or not.
On one occasion he hit me all over with his shoe. My face
and body became swollen and bruised. So I left the house
and went to my uncle. But my uncle told me that all
husbands beat their wives, and my uncle’s wife added that
her husband often beat her. I said my uncle was a respected
Sheikh, well versed in the teachings of religion, and he,
therefore, could not possibly be in the habit of beating his
wife. She replied that it was precisely men well versed in
their religion who beat their wives. The precepts of religion
permitted such punishment. A virtuous woman was not
supposed to complain about her husband. Her duty was
perfect obedience.
I was at a loss what to answer. Before the servant girl had
even started putting lunch on the table, my uncle took me
back to my husband’s house. When we arrived he had
already eaten his lunch alone. Night fell, but he did not ask
me whether I was hungry. He had his dinner alone and in
silence, without addressing a single word to me. Next
morning, I prepared breakfast and he sat down on his chair
to eat, but avoided looking at me. When I sat down at the
table, he looked up and started to stare ﬁxedly at my plate. I
was terribly hungry and felt a crying need to eat something,
come what may. I put my hand in the plate and raised it to
my mouth with a morsel of food. But no sooner had I done
this than he jumped up shouting:
‘Why did you come back from your uncle’s house?
Couldn’t he bear to feed you for a few days? Now you will
realize I’m the only person who can put up with you, and
who is prepared to feed you. Why do you shy away from me
then? Why do you turn your face away from mine? Am I
ugly? Do I smell? Why do you keep at a distance whenever I
come near to you?’
He leapt on me like a mad dog. The hole in his swelling
was oozing drops of foul-smelling pus. I did not turn my face
or my nose away this time. I surrendered my face to his face
and my body to his body, passively, without any resistance,
without a movement, as though life had been drained out of
it, like a piece of dead wood or old neglected furniture left to
stand where it is, or a pair of shoes forgotten under a chair.
One day he hit me with his heavy stick until the blood ran
from my nose and ears. So I left, but this time I did not go to
my uncle’s house. I walked through the streets with swollen
eyes, and a bruised face, but no one paid any attention to
me. People were rushing around in buses and in cars, or on
foot. It was as though they were blind, unable to see
anything. The street was an endless expanse stretched out
before my eyes like a sea. I was just a pebble thrown into it,
battered by the waves, tossed here and there, rolling over
and over to be abandoned somewhere on the shore. After
some time I was worn out by walking, so I sat down to rest
on an empty chair that I suddenly came upon placed upright
on the pavement. A strong smell of coﬀee reached my
nostrils. I realized my tongue was dry, and that I was
hungry. When the waiter boy came up to me and asked me
what I would like to drink, I begged him to bring me a glass
of water.
He looked at me angrily, and said that the coﬀee-house
was not for passers by. He added that the Sayeda Zeinab
mausoleum was very close, and that there I could ﬁnd all
the water I needed. I raised my eyes to look at him. He
stared at me, and then asked me what had caused all the
bruises on my face. I tried to say something in reply, but the
words would not come so I hid my face in my hands and
wept. He hesitated for a moment, then left me, and came
back after a while carrying a glass of water. But when I put
the glass to my lips, the water stuck in my throat, as though
I was choking, and trickled back out of my mouth. After
some time the owner of the coﬀee-house came over to
where I was sitting and asked me what my name was.
‘Firdaus,’ I said.
Then he added, ‘What are all these bruises on your face?
Has somebody hit you?’
Once more I tried to explain but my voice choked again. I
was breathing with diﬃculty, and kept swallowing my tears.
He said, ‘Stay here and rest for a while. I will bring you a cup
of hot tea. Are you hungry?’
All the time I kept my eyes ﬁxed on the ground, and did
not raise them to look at his face even once. His voice was
low, with a slight hoarseness which reminded me of my
father. After he had eaten his meal, and beaten my mother
and calmed down, he would ask me,
‘Are you hungry?’
For the ﬁrst time in my life I suddenly felt my father had
been a good man, that I missed him, and deep down inside
had loved him without really knowing it. I heard the man
say,
‘Is your father alive?’
I answered, ‘No, he’s dead,’ and for the ﬁrst time wept at
the thought that he had died. The man patted my shoulder
and said,
‘Everyone has to die, Firdaus,’ and added, ‘What about
your mother? Is she alive?’
‘No,’ I replied.
He insisted, ‘Haven’t you got any family? A brother, or an
uncle of some sort?’
I shook my head, repeating, ‘No,’ then quickly opened my
small bag, adding, ‘I have a secondary school certiﬁcate.
Maybe I can ﬁnd a job with my secondary, or with my
primary school certiﬁcate. But if necessary I’m prepared to
do anything, even the kind of work that requires no
certiﬁcates.’
His name was Bayoumi. When I lifted my eyes and looked
into his face, I felt no fear. His nose resembled that of my
father. It was big and rounded, and he had the same dark
complexion. His eyes were resigned and calm. They did not
seem to me like the eyes of someone who would kill. His
hands looked obedient, almost submissive, their movements
quiet, relaxed. They did not impress me as the hands of
someone who could be violent or cruel. He told me he lived
in two rooms and that I could stay in one of them until I
found work. On the way to his house he stopped in front of a
fruit stall and said,
‘Do you prefer oranges or tangerines?’
I tried to reply but my voice failed me. No one had asked
me before whether I preferred oranges or tangerines. My
father never bought us fruit. My uncle and my husband used
to buy it without asking me what I preferred. As a matter of
fact, I myself had never thought whether I preferred oranges
to tangerines, or tangerines to oranges. I heard him ask me
again,
‘Do you like oranges or tangerines?’
‘Tangerines,’ I answered. But after he had bought them, I
realized that I liked oranges better, but I was ashamed to
say so, because the tangerines were cheaper.
Bayoumi had a small two-room ﬂat in a narrow lane. It
overlooked the ﬁsh market. I used to sweep and clean the
rooms, buy ﬁsh from the market below us, or a rabbit, or
meat and cook for him. He worked all day in the coﬀee-
house without eating, and when he came back at the end of
the day he would eat a heavy meal, and then go to sleep in
his room. I used to sleep in the other room lying on the ﬂoor
with a mattress under my body.
The ﬁrst time I went home with him it was winter and the
night was cold. He said to me,
‘You take the bed, and I will sleep on the ﬂoor.’
But I refused. I lay down on the ﬂoor and started to fall
asleep. But he came over to me, took hold of my arm, and
took me to the bed. I moved by his side with bent head. I
was so embarrassed, that I stumbled several times. Never in
my life had anyone put me ﬁrst before himself. My father
used to occupy the oven room in winter, and leave me the
coldest room in the house. My uncle had the bed to himself,
while I slept on the wooden couch. Later on, when I married,
my husband ate twice as much food as I did, yet his eyes
never lifted themselves from my plate.
I stood for a moment near the bed and murmured: ‘But I
cannot sleep on the bed.’
I heard him say, ‘I will not let you sleep on the ﬂoor.’
My head was still bent to the ground. He kept his hand
clasped around my arm. I could see it was a big hand with
long ﬁngers like those of my uncle when he touched me,
and now they were trembling in exactly the same way. And
so I closed my eyes.
I felt the sudden touch of him, like a dream remembered
from the distant past, or some memory that began with life.
My body pulsed with an obscure pleasure, or with a pain
that was not really pain but pleasure, with a pleasure I had
never known before, had lived in another life that was not
my life, or in another body that was not my body.
I ended up by sleeping in his bed throughout the winter
and the following summer. He never raised a hand to strike
me, and never looked at my plate while I was eating. When I
cooked ﬁsh I used to give it all to him, and just take the
head or the tail for myself. Or if it was rabbit I cooked, I gave
him the whole rabbit and nibbled at the head. I always left
the table without satisfying my hunger. On my way to
market my eyes would follow the schoolgirls as they walked
through the streets, and I would remember that at one time
I had been one of them, and had obtained a secondary
school certiﬁcate. And one day I stopped right in front of a
group of schoolgirls and stood there facing them. They eyed
me up and down with disdain for there was a strong smell of
ﬁsh arising from my clothes. I explained to them that I had
been awarded a secondary school certiﬁcate. They started
to make fun of me, and I heard one of them whisper into her
friend’s ear:
‘She must be mad. Can’t you see, she’s talking to
herself?’
But I was not talking to myself. I was just telling them that
I had a secondary school certiﬁcate.
That night when Bayoumi came home, I said, ‘I have a
secondary school certiﬁcate, and I want to work.’
‘Every day the coﬀee-house is crowded with youths, who
are out of work, and all of them have university degrees,’ he
said.
‘But I must work. I can’t carry on like this.’
Without looking me in the face, he said, ‘What do you
mean, you can’t carry on like this?
‘I cannot continue to live in your house,’ I stammered. ‘I’m
a woman, and you’re a man, and people are talking.
Besides, you promised I’d stay only until you found me a
job.’
He retorted angrily, ‘What can I do, get the heavens to
intervene for you?’
‘You’re busy all day in the coﬀee-house, and you haven’t
even tried to ﬁnd me a job. I’m going out now to look for
one.’
I was speaking in low tones, and my eyes were ﬁxed on
the ground, but he jumped up and slapped me on the face,
saying, ‘How dare you raise your voice when you’re
speaking to me, you street walker, you low woman?’
His hand was big and strong, and it was the heaviest slap I
had ever received on my face. My head swayed ﬁrst to one
side, then to the other. The walls and the ﬂoor seemed to
shift violently. I held my head in my hands until they grew
still again, then I looked upwards and our eyes met.
It was as though I was seeing the eyes that now
confronted me for the ﬁrst time. Two jet black surfaces that
stared into my eyes, travelled with an inﬁnitely slow
movement over my face, and my neck, and then dropped
downwards gradually over my breast, and my belly, to settle
somewhere just below it, between my thighs. A cold shiver,
like the shiver of death, went through my body, and my
hands dropped instinctively to cover the part on which his
gaze was ﬁxed, but his big strong hands moved quickly to
jerk them away. The next moment he hit me with his ﬁst in
the belly so hard that I lost consciousness immediately.
He took to locking me in the ﬂat before going out. I now
slept on the ﬂoor in the other room. He would come back in
the middle of the night, pull the cover away from me, slap
my face, and then bear down on me with all his weight. I
kept my eyes closed and abandoned my body. It lay there
under him without movement, emptied of all desire, or
pleasure, or even pain, feeling nothing. A dead body with no
life in it at all, like a piece of wood, or an empty sock, or a
shoe. Then one night his body seemed heavier than before,
and his breath smelt diﬀerent, so I opened my eyes. The
face above me was not Bayoumi’s.
‘Who are you?’ I said.
‘Bayoumi,’ he answered.
I insisted, ‘You are not Bayoumi. Who are you?’
‘What diﬀerence does it make? Bayoumi and I are one.’
Then he asked, ‘Do you feel pleasure?’
‘What did you say?’ I enquired.
‘Do you feel pleasure?’ he repeated.
I was afraid to say I felt nothing so I closed my eyes once
more and said, ‘Yes.’
He sank his teeth into the ﬂesh of my shoulder and bit me
several times in the breast, and then over my belly. While he
was biting me, he kept on repeating:
‘Slut, bitch.’ Then he started insulting my mother in words
I was not able to follow. Later on, when I tried to pronounce
them, I was not able. But after that night I heard them often
from Bayoumi, and from Bayoumi’s friends. So I got used to
their sound, and learnt to use them occasionally myself
when I tried to open the door and found it locked. I would
hammer on it and scream:
‘Bayoumi, you son of a…’ almost on the point of insulting
his mother in the same way, but I held back the words on
the tip of my tongue, realizing that this would be wrong. So I
resorted to insulting his father instead of his mother.
One day a neighbour saw me through the lattice of the
door as I stood there weeping. She asked me what was
wrong, so I told her. She started crying with me and
suggested that we call the police. But the word police
frightened me. Instead, I asked her to bring a carpenter.
After a while he came and forced the door open. I ran out of
Bayoumi’s house into the street. For the street had become
the only safe place in which I could seek refuge, and into
which I could escape with my whole being. As I ran, I looked
back over my shoulder now and again to make sure that
Bayoumi was not following me. And every time I found that
his face was not visible anywhere, I leapt forwards as fast as
I could run.
* * *
At the end of the day I found myself walking down a street
without knowing where I was. It was a clean, paved
thoroughfare, which ran along one bank of the Nile with tall
trees on either side. The houses were surrounded by fences
and gardens. The air which entered my lungs was pure and
free of dust. I saw a stone bench facing the river. I sat down
on it, and lifted my face to the refreshing breeze. I had
barely closed my eyes in rest, when I heard a woman’s voice
asking:
‘What is your name?’
I opened my eyes to ﬁnd a woman seated next to me. She
was wearing a green shawl, and her eyes were shadowed
with green make-up. The black pupils in the centre of her
eyes seemed to have turned green, a powerful dark green,
like the trees on the bank of the Nile. The waters of the river
reﬂected the green of the trees, and ﬂowed by as green as
her eyes. The sky over our heads was as blue as the bluest
sky, but the colours mingled and everything around radiated
this liquid green light which surrounded me, enveloped me
completely, so that I felt myself gradually drowning in it.
It was strange, this sensation of drowning in dark green, in
a dark green with a density of its own, a consistency of its
own, like the feel of water in the sea, a sea in which I was
sleeping, and dreaming, in which I was sinking as I slept and
dreamt, in which I was gradually sinking without getting
wet, gradually dropping without getting drowned. I felt
myself lying on its bed at one moment, swallowed deep
down inside, and a moment later carried gently upwards,
ﬂoating higher and higher back to its surface, without
moving an arm or a leg.
I felt my eyelids getting heavier as if I were about to fall
asleep, but her voice echoed in my ears again. It was a
smooth voice, its depths so soft that it sounded almost
drowsy. It said,
‘You are tired.’
I forced up my eyelids with an eﬀort and said, ‘Yes.’
The green in her eyes grew even more intense. ‘What did
the son of a dog do to you?’ she asked.
I gave a start like someone who has suddenly been
awakened from sleep. ‘Whom do you mean?’ I asked.
She wrapped the shawl around her shoulders more
closely, yawned and continued in the same soft drowsy
voice.
‘Any one of them, it doesn’t make any diﬀerence. They’re
all the same, all sons of dogs, running around under various
names. Mahmoud, Hassanein, Fawzy, Sabri, Ibrahim,
Awadain, Bayoumi.’
I interrupted her with a gasp. ‘Bayoumi?!’
She laughed out loud. I glimpsed her small, white pointed
teeth, with a gold tooth right in the middle.
‘I know them all. Which one of them started it? Your
father, your brother… one of your uncles?’
This time my body gave a violent start which almost lifted
it oﬀ the stone bench.
‘My uncle,’ I replied in a low voice.
She laughed again and tossed the green shawl backwards
over one shoulder.
‘And what did Bayoumi do to you?’ She was silent for a
moment, and then added, ‘You haven’t told me your name.
What’s your name?’
‘Firdaus. And you? Who are you?’ I asked.
She stiﬀened her back and neck with a movement full of a
strange pride. ‘I am Sharifa Salah el Dine. Everyone knows
me.’
On the way to her apartment I talked all the time,
describing the things that had happened to me. We left the
road which ran along the river and turned oﬀ into a small
side street, and after a little while halted in front of a large
apartment building. I trembled as I felt myself carried
upwards by the lift. She took a key out of her bag, and the
next moment I stepped into a spotless apartment with
carpeted ﬂoors, and a spacious terrace overlooking the Nile.
She took me to the bathroom, showed me how to turn the
hot and cold water taps on and oﬀ, so I could have a bath,
and gave me some of her clothes. They were soft clothes
with a lovely smell of perfume, and her ﬁngers too were soft
as she combed my hair, and arranged the collar of my dress
around the neck. Everything around me had this smooth,
soft quality about it. I closed my eyes, and abandoned
myself to the softness of things. I felt my body was now like
that of a new-born baby, soft and smooth like everything
else in the ﬂat.
When I opened my eyes and looked into the mirror I
realized that now I was being born again with a new body,
smooth and tender as a rose petal. My clothes were no
longer rough and dirty, but soft and clean. The house shone
with cleanliness. Even the air was clean. I breathed deeply
to ﬁll my lungs with this pure air. I turned around and saw
her. She was standing close by watching me, her eyes
radiating a strong, green light, the colour of the trees, and
the sky, and the waters of the Nile. I abandoned myself to
her eyes, and put my arms around her, whispering: ‘Who
are you?’
And she replied, ‘Your mother.’
‘My mother died many years ago.’
‘Then your sister.’
‘I have neither sister, nor brother. They all died when they
were small, like chicks.’
‘Everybody has to die, Firdaus. I will die, and you will
die.The important thing is how to live until you die.’
‘How is it possible to live? Life is so hard.’
‘You must be harder than life, Firdaus. Life is very hard.
The only people who really live are those who are harder
than life itself.’
‘But you are not hard, Sharifa, so how do you manage to
live?’
‘I am hard, terribly hard, Firdaus.’
‘No, you are gentle, and soft.’
‘My skin is soft, but my heart is cruel, and my bite deadly.’
‘Like a snake?’
‘Yes, exactly like a snake. Life is a snake. They are the
same, Firdaus. If the snake realizes you are not a snake, it
will bite you. And if life knows you have no sting, it will
devour you.’
* * *
I became a young novice in Sharifa’s hands. She opened my
eyes to life, to events in my past, in my childhood, which
had remained hidden to my mind. She probed with a
searching light revealing obscure areas of myself, unseen
features of my face and body, making me become aware of
them, understand them, see them for the ﬁrst time.
I discovered I had black eyes, with a sparkle that attracted
other eyes like a magnet, and that my nose was neither big,
nor rounded, but full and smooth with the fullness of strong
passion which could turn to lust. My body was slender, my
thighs tense, alive with muscle, ready at any moment to
grow even more taut. I realized that I had not hated my
mother, nor loved my uncle, nor really known Bayoumi, or
any other man who belonged to his gang.
Sharifa said to me one day, ‘Neither Bayoumi nor any of
his cronies realized your worth, because you failed to value
yourself highly enough. A man does not know a woman’s
value, Firdaus. She is the one who determines her value.
The higher you price yourself, the more he will realize what
you are really worth, and be prepared to pay with the means
at his disposal. And if he has no means, he will steal from
someone else to give you what you demand.’
I was seized with wonder and asked her, ‘And am I really
of any value, Sharifa?’
‘You are beautiful and have culture.’
‘Culture?’ I said. ‘All I have is a secondary school
certiﬁcate.’
‘You belittle yourself, Firdaus. I never got further than a
primary school certiﬁcate.’
‘And do you have a price?’ I asked cautiously.
‘Of course. Nobody can touch me without paying a very
high price. You are younger than I am and more cultured,
and nobody should be able to come near you without paying
twice as much as what is paid to me.’
‘But I cannot ask for anything from a man.’
‘Don’t ask for anything. That’s not your aﬀair. It’s mine.’
* * *
Can the Nile, and the sky, and the trees change? I had
changed, so why not the Nile and the colour of the trees?
When I opened the window every morning I could see the
Nile ﬂow by, contemplate the green of the water, and the
trees, the vivid green light in which everything seemed to
bathe, feel the power of life, of my body, of the hot blood in
my veins. My body ﬁlled with a warmth as soft as the touch
of the silken clothes in which I dressed, or the silken bed in
which I slept. My nose ﬁlled with the fragrance of roses
wafted across the open spaces. I let myself sink in this
feeling of warmth and softness, drown in the perfume of
gentle roses, savour the comfort of the silken sheets as I
stretched my legs, and of the smooth pillow under my head.
I drank in the liquid softness through my nose, my mouth,
my ears, through every pore in my body with a thirst which
knew no end.
At night, moonbeams ﬂowed over me, silky and white, like
the ﬁngers of the man who lay by my side. His nails, too,
were clean and white, not like Bayoumi’s nails, which were
black as the night, nor like my uncle’s nails with their edge
of dark earth on the underside. I would close my lids and let
my body bathe in the silvery light, let the silken ﬁngers
touch my face and lips, move down to my neck and bury
themselves between my breasts.
I would nurse them between my breasts for a while, leave
them to slip down over my belly, and then below it to the
place between my thighs. Deep inside my body I could feel
a strange trembling. At ﬁrst it was like pleasure, a pleasure
akin to pain. It ended with pain, a pain which felt like
pleasure. It belonged to a distant past, had been with me
somehow right from the beginning. I had experienced it long
ago, but forgotten it at the time. Yet it seemed to go back
even further than my life, to some day before I was born,
like a thing arising out of an ancient wound, in an organ
which had ceased to be mine, on the body of a woman who
was no longer me.
One day I asked Sharifa: ‘Why don’t I feel anything?’
‘We work, Firdaus, we just work. Don’t mix feeling with
work.’
‘But I want to feel, Sharifa,’ I exclaimed.
‘You will get nothing out of feeling except pain.’
‘Is there no pleasure to be had, even the slightest
pleasure?’
She burst out laughing. I could see her small white,
pointed teeth, with the gold tooth in the middle. She went
quiet all of a sudden and looked at me gravely, then said,
‘Does it not give you pleasure to eat roast chicken and
rice? Does it not give you pleasure to wear these soft, silky
clothes? Do you not feel pleasure at living in this warm,
clean house, with its windows overlooking the Nile? Does it
not give you pleasure when you open the window every
morning, and look out at the Nile, and the sky, and the
trees? Isn’t all this suﬃcient for you? Why do you ask for
more?’
It was not out of greed that I was thinking of other things.
One morning I had opened the window as usual, but the Nile
was no longer there. I knew the Nile was in the same place,
its waters stretched out before my eyes, but I could no
longer see it, as though the human eye is incapable of
seeing what is within its reach. The perfumes which I had all
around me, under my nose, they too had disappeared. I was
unable to detect their odour, as though my nose, just like
my eyes, could no longer register the things which were
there in front of it. The softness, the silk, the comfortable
bed, all the things I knew were still there, no longer existed
for me.
I never used to leave the house. In fact, I never even left
the bedroom. Day and night I lay on the bed, cruciﬁed, and
every hour a man would come in. There were so many of
them. I did not understand where they could possibly have
come from. For they were all married, all educated, all
carrying swollen leather bags, and swollen leather wallets in
their inner pockets. Their swollen heavy paunches hung
down with too much food, and their sweat ran copiously,
ﬁlling my nostrils with a foetid smell, like stagnant water, as
though it had been held back in their bodies for a long time.
I turned my face away, but they insisted on pulling it back,
on burying my nose in the smell of their bodies. They dug
their long nails into my ﬂesh and I would close my lips
tightly trying to stiﬂe any expression of pain, to hold back a
scream, but in spite of my eﬀorts they would part and let
out a low, muﬄed moan. Often the man would hear it and
mutter stupidly in my ear,
‘Do you feel good?’
In answer I would purse my lips and prepare to spit in his
face, but he would start biting them with his teeth. I could
feel his thick saliva between my lips and with a push of the
tongue sent it back into his mouth.
Among all these men there was only one man who was
not stupid, and did not ask me if I was feeling good. Instead
he queried,
‘Do you feel any pain?’
‘Yes,’ I said.
‘What’s your name?’
‘Firdaus. And you?’
‘I’m Fawzy.’
‘How did you realize I was feeling pain?’
‘Because I feel you.’
‘You can feel me?’ I exclaimed with amazement.
‘Yes,’ he said. ‘What about you. Do you also feel me?’
‘I don’t feel anything.’
‘Why?’
‘I do not know. Sharifa told me work is work, and that
feelings do not come in where work is concerned.’
He gave a short laugh and kissed me on the lips. ‘Sharifa’s
fooling you, and making money out of you, while all you get
out of it is the pain.’
I cried. He wiped my tears away and took me in his arms. I
closed my eyes and he kissed me gently on the lids. I heard
him whisper: ‘Do you want to sleep?’
‘Yes.’
‘Then sleep in my arms.’
‘But what about Sharifa?’
‘Don’t be afraid of Sharifa.’
‘And you? Aren’t you afraid of her?’
He gave another of his short laughs and said, ‘She is the
one who fears me.’
I was still asleep in my bed with my eyes closed when I
heard soft voices from beyond the wall separating Sharifa’s
room from mine. I heard her speaking to a man whose voice
sounded familiar.
‘You’re going to take her away from me?’
‘I shall marry her, Sharifa.’
‘Not you. You don’t marry.’
‘That’s all over. Now I’m older and want a son.’
‘So that he can inherit your wealth?’
‘Don’t be sarcastic at my expense, Sharifa. If I wanted I
could have become a millionaire, but I am a man who lives
for the pleasures of life. I earn money to spend it. I refuse to
be a slave, either to money, or to love.’
‘Do you love her, Fawzy?’
‘Am I capable of love? You told me once that I had lost the
ability to love.’
‘You neither love, nor marry. All you want to do is to take
her away from me, just as you took Camelia away before.’
‘It was Camelia who came with me.’
‘She fell in love with you, didn’t she?’
‘So women love me. Is that my fault?’
‘Woe betide any woman that loves you, Fawzy.’
‘That’s if I’m not in love with her myself.’
‘And can you love a woman?’
‘Sometimes. It does happen.’
‘Were you in love with me once?’
‘Are you going to start harking back to that question
again? I haven’t got time to waste as you know, and I’m
taking Firdaus with me.’
‘You’re not taking her.’
‘I am taking her.’
‘Are you threatening me, Fawzy? I’m not afraid of your
threats any more. You can’t get the police on to me. I have
more friends and connections in the police than you have.’
‘Am I a man who has recourse to the police? Only a weak
man needs to do that. And do you think I am a weak man,
Sharifa?’
‘What do you mean?’
‘You know what I mean.’
‘You’re going to beat me up, is that it?’
‘It’s a long time since I last hit you. It looks as though
you’re yearning for a good hiding.’
‘If you hit me I will hit back, Fawzy.’
‘That’s ﬁne. We’ll see who’s the stronger of the two.’
‘If you so much as lay a ﬁnger on me I’ll get Shawki on to
you.’
‘Who the hell is this Shawki of yours? Do you have another
man? Are you in love with someone else? Do you dare?’
I was unable to hear Sharifa’s reply through the wall.
Perhaps her voice was so low that it did not reach me. Or he
may have covered her mouth with his hand before she could
say anything more. For I heard what seemed to me the
sound of a hand being clapped over a mouth, followed by
another sound very much like that of someone’s hand
patting a face. Then came a series of muﬄed noises. I was
unable to tell whether they were gentle slaps on the face, or
violent kisses. But after a short while I heard Sharifa
protesting:
‘No, Fawzy, no!’
His voice sounded like an angry hiss. ‘No. No what, you
slut?’
The bed creaked under them, then once again I heard
Sharifa’s voice like a series of gasps followed by the same
protesting tone.
‘No, Fawzy. For the Prophet’s sake. You must not, you must
not!!’
Through the wall came his panting angry hiss again. ‘What
the hell, woman! Must not what, and Prophet what? Who’s
this Shawki? I’ll cut his throat.’
The creaking grew louder under the weight of the two
bodies, as they embraced each other, wrestled with one
another, alternately closing in and separating in a
continuous movement which soon mounted to a strangely
rapid, almost mad frenzy, shaking the bed under them
violently with the shudders of a wild animal short of breath.
The ﬂoor seemed to shake and pant. Then it was the wall.
Even the bed on which I was lying picked up the frenzied
rhythm, and began to shake.
The violent shaking went to my head. It was as though I
awakened suddenly to what was going on around me. I saw
Fawzy’s face take shape out of a mist, as if in a dream, and I
heard his voice echoing in my ears again:
‘Sharifa’s fooling you. She’s making money out of you.’
Then came Sharifa’s voice as she said:
‘If you hit me, Fawzy, I will hit back.’
I opened my eyes. My body was stretched out on the bed
without a man beside me, and the room around was dark
and empty. I walked on the tip of my toes to Sharifa’s room,
and found her lying naked with Fawzy at her side. I tiptoed
back to my room, put on the ﬁrst dress I could lay my hands
on, took my little bag, and hurried down the ﬂights of stairs
into the street.
* * *
It was night, a pitch black night with no moon. A bitterly
cold, winter night, with the streets of the city completely
deserted, and with the windows and the doors of the houses
all ﬁrmly closed to prevent the slightest draught of air from
penetrating. There I was walking through the cold, wearing
a thin, almost transparent dress, and yet I did not feel it. I
was surrounded by darkness on all sides, with nowhere to
go, but I was no longer afraid. Nothing in the streets was
capable of scaring me any longer, and the coldest wind
could no longer bite into my body. Had my body changed?
Had I been transported into another woman’s body? And
where had my own, my real body, gone?
I started to examine the ﬁngers of my hands. The ﬁngers
were mine, they had not changed. Long slender ﬁngers. One
of the men once said he had never seen ﬁngers like these
before. He said they looked strong and clever. That they
possessed a language of their own. When he kissed them
they seemed to speak to him with a voice he could almost
hear. I laughed and brought my ﬁngers close up to my ears,
but could hear nothing. I laughed again, and this time my
laughter echoed in my ears. I was taken aback to hear my
own laughter in the silent night. I looked around me
cautiously, fearing that someone might hear me laughing
alone, and carry me oﬀ to the Abbasseya Mental Hospital. At
ﬁrst I could see nothing, but a moment later I glimpsed a
policeman approaching in the dark. He came right up to me,
caught me by the arm, and said:
‘Where are you going?’
‘I don’t know.’
‘Will you come with me?’
‘Where to?’
‘To my house.’
‘No… I have no trust in men any more.’
I opened my small bag, and showed him my secondary
school certiﬁcate. I told him I was looking for a job with my
secondary, or even with my primary school certiﬁcate. That
if I did not ﬁnd something this way, I was prepared to do any
work.
He said, ‘I’ll pay you. Don’t think I want to have you for
nothing. I am not like other policemen. How much do you
want?’
‘How much do I want? I don’t know.’
‘Don’t play games with me, and don’t try to haggle with
me either, or I’ll take you oﬀ to the police station.’
‘Why? I haven’t done anything.’
‘You’re a prostitute, and it’s my duty to arrest you, and
others of your kind. To clean up the country, and protect
respectable families from the likes of you. But I don’t want
to use force. Perhaps we can agree quietly without a fuss. I’ll
give you a pound: a whole pound. What do you say to that?’
I tried to shake free of him, but he held on to my arm, and
started to walk me away from where we were standing. He
took me through one dark, narrow alley after another, then
through a wooden door into a room, where he made me lie
down on a bed. He took oﬀ his clothes. I closed my eyes as I
felt the familiar weight bear down on me, the familiar
movement of ﬁngers with dirty black nails travelling over
my body, the panting breath, the foul sticky sweat, the
shaking of the bed, and the ﬂoor, and the walls, as though
the world was turning round and round. I opened my eyes,
dragged my body oﬀ the bed, put on my dress, and then
leant my head, my tired head, against the door for a
moment before leaving. I heard his voice say from behind
me:
‘What are you waiting for? I have no money on me
tonight. I’ll give you money the next time.’
I walked away through the narrow streets. It was still night
and the air was bitterly cold. Now rain had started to fall,
turning the dusty ground under my feet to mud. There were
piles of rubbish in front of the houses, and the smell of rot
seemed to envelop me on all sides, to overcome me, to
drown me under it, and I kept walking faster, trying to
escape, to get out of the narrow twisting streets and alleys
on to a tarred road, any tarred road on which I could step
without sinking my shoes in mud.
When I reached one of the main roads the rain was still
pouring down over my head. I sought shelter at one of the
bus stops, took a handkerchief out of my bag, and started to
wipe my face, my hair, my eyes. A white light penetrated to
my eyes, and at ﬁrst I thought it was the white colour of my
handkerchief, but when I took it away, the light continued to
shine brightly in my eyes, like the headlamps of a bus. I
thought it was dawn, and that the buses had already
started. But it was not a bus. It was a car which had pulled
up in front of me with its headlights full in my eyes. Then a
man got out and circled quickly round the car, opened the
door on my side, bowed slightly and then very politely said:
‘Please do get in out of the rain.’
I was shivering with cold, and my light dress was clinging
to my body, soaked in rain. My breasts were showing almost
naked under my dress, the nipples standing out in two dark
circles. As he helped me into the car, he pressed his arm
against them.
It was warm inside his house, and he helped me out of my
dress, took oﬀ my muddy shoes, and washed my body with
warm water and soap. Then he carried me to the bed. I
closed my eyes as I felt the weight press heavily down on
my chest and belly, and the ﬁngers move over my body. But
the nails were clean and manicured, the panting breath had
an odour of scent, and the sweat ran sticky, but fresh.
When I opened my eyes I was bathing in sunlight. I looked
around unable to recognize where I was. There I was, lying
in an elegant bedroom, with a stranger standing in front of
me. I got up quickly and put on my dress and shoes. As I
picked up my little bag and started to move towards the
door, he stretched out his arm and slipped a ten pound note
between my ﬁngers. It was as if he had lifted a veil from my
eyes, and I was seeing for the ﬁrst time. The movement of
my hand as I clasped the ten pound note solved the enigma
in one swift, sweeping movement, tore away the shroud that
covered up a truth I had in fact experienced when still a
child, when for the ﬁrst time my father gave me a piastre, a
coin to hold in my hand, and be mine. My father had never
given me money. I worked in the ﬁelds, and worked in the
house, and together with my mother ate the scraps of food
left over from my father. And on those days when there was
no food left over from him, I went to bed without supper. On
the Eed El Kebir I saw the children buy candy from a
sweetshop. I went to my mother crying loudly ‘Give me a
piastre.’
She answered, ‘I have no piastres. It’s your father who has
the piastres.’
So I went in search of my father and asked him for a
piastre. He hit me on my hand and shouted, ‘I have no
piastres.’
But a moment later he called me back and said, ‘I’ll give
you a piastre if Allah is bountiful to us and we manage to
sell the buﬀalo before she dies.’
After that I saw him praying and exhorting Allah to delay
the hour of her death. But the buﬀalo died before anyone
could do anything. My father ceased his prayers and
exhortations to Allah throughout the Eed, and whenever my
mother said something to him he would jump at her and
give her a beating. I refrained from asking him for a piastre
but later, on the occasion of the Eed El Sagheer, I noticed
the sweets piled up in the shop, and said to my father,
‘Give me a piastre.’
This time he said, ‘Do you ask for a piastre, ﬁrst thing in
the morning? Go and clean under the animals and load the
ass and take her to the ﬁelds. At the end of the day I shall
give you a piastre.’
And in fact, when I returned from the ﬁelds at the end of
that day, he gave me the piastre. It was the ﬁrst piastre he
had ever given me, the ﬁrst piastre that was all mine, to put
in the palm of my hand, and surround with my ﬁngers, and
squeeze. It was not my father’s and not my mother’s, but
mine; mine to do with it what I wanted, to buy what I
wanted, to eat with it whatever I desired, whether sweets,
or carob, or molass sticks, or anything else I might choose.
The sun was shining brightly that day. I walked with a
quick, energetic step, my right ﬁst clenched tightly over
something in my palm, something really valuable, not just a
piastre this time, but a whole ten pound note. It was the ﬁrst
time I had held such a big note in my hand. As a matter of
fact, it was the ﬁrst time my ﬁngers had even touched a
note of that kind. The sudden contact sent a strange
tautness through my body, an inner contraction as though
something had jumped inside me and shaken my body with
a violence which was almost painful. I felt as if something
was pulsating out from a wound buried deep in my guts.
When I stretched the muscles of my back, stood upright and
breathed deeply it hurt. I could feel it rise up to my belly like
a shiver, like blood beating strongly through the veins. The
hot blood in my chest rose to my neck, swept through to my
throat, to become a ﬂow of warm rich saliva, bringing with it
a savour of pleasure, so strong, so poignant that it was
almost bitter.
I swallowed my saliva several times as I stood facing a
glass partition behind which chickens were roasting on a
brightly burning ﬂame. My eyes gazed at them as they
turned on the iron skewer over the leaping ﬂames. I chose a
table near a window so that it was covered in sunlight and
ordered a fat, brown chicken. I sat down and started to eat it
slowly, very slowly, chewing every morsel, keeping it in my
mouth for a long moment before swallowing. My mouth was
full, like that of a child stuﬃng itself with sweets, and the
food had a strong, delicious taste, a strange powerful
sweetness about it, like the sweetness of the molass stick
bought with my ﬁrst piastre. Yet that was not the ﬁrst
molass stick I had tasted, for my mother had bought me
molass sticks before. But it was the ﬁrst one I had chosen
myself from amongst the other sweets in the shop, the ﬁrst
one bought with my own piastre.
The waiter bent over the table to place the other plates in
front of me. He stretched out a hand with a plate full of
food, but his eyes looked elsewhere, did not linger over my
plate. The movement of his eyes as they avoided my plate
cut like a knife through the veil which hung over my eyes,
and I realized this was the ﬁrst time in my life I was eating
without being watched by two eyes gazing into my plate to
see how much food I took. Ever since I was born those two
eyes had always been there, wide open, staring, unﬂinching,
following every morsel of food on my plate.
Was it possible that a mere piece of paper could make
such a change? Why had I not realized this before? Was I
really unaware of this throughout the years? No. Now that I
thought about it I could see that I had known it for a very
long time, right from the start, when I was born and opened
my eyes to look at my father for the ﬁrst time. All I could
see of him was a ﬁst, its ﬁngers closed strongly over
something in the palm of his hand. He never opened up his
ﬁngers, and even when he did, always kept something
behind in his hand, something bright in colour, and circular
in shape, something he used to handle gently with his big
rough ﬁngers or drop on a smooth stone so that it let out a
ringing sound.
I was still sitting in the sun. The ten pound note lay in my
bag, for I had not yet paid for my meal. I opened my bag to
take it out. The waiter approached, bowed over the table
with a movement of respectful humility and started to
collect the plates. He kept his eyes away from my bag,
looking all the while in another direction as though avoiding
the ten pound note. I had seen this movement of the eyes
before, this lowering of the lids, this almost imperceptible
glance at my hand. It reminded me of my husband, Sheikh
Mahmoud, as he kneeled in prayer, his eyes half-closed, of
the glances he stole now and then at my plate; and of my
uncle as he followed the lines in his book with peering eyes
while his hand stole out from behind, searching for my
thigh. The waiter was still standing upright by my side. His
half-closed lids drooping over the eyes, his stealthy way of
glancing aside were the same. I held the ten pound note in
my hand, and he watched it through the corner of one eye,
while his other eye looked away as though shunning the
forbidden parts of a woman’s body. I was seized with a
feeling of wonder. Could it be that the ten pound note I held
in my hand was as illicit and forbidden as the thrill of
sacrilegious pleasure?
I almost opened my mouth to ask the waiter, ‘Who has
decided that the ten pound note is to be considered
forbidden?’ But I kept my lips pressed tightly together for I
had, in fact, known the answer all along, found it out many
years ago, right from the moment when my father hit me
over the hand when I ﬁrst held it out for a coin. It was a
lesson oft repeated, as time went by. My mother had once
beaten me for losing a piastre in the market place, and
returning home without it. My uncle was in the habit of
giving me money, but warned me not to mention anything
about it to my mother. My uncle’s wife used to hide the
piastres in her bodice whenever she heard me approaching
before she had ﬁnished counting. My husband counted his
piastres almost every day, but as soon as he saw me
coming, he put them away.
And Sharifa, too, would count the pound notes, and stack
them quickly in some secret recess the moment she heard
my voice. And so, as the years went by, I began to look in
the other direction every time I saw someone count his
money, or even take a few coins out of his or her pocket. It
was as though money was a shameful thing, made to be
hidden, an object of sin which was forbidden to me and yet
permissible for others, as though it had been made
legitimate only for them. I was on the point of asking the
waiter who it was that had decided all this, who it was that
had decided for whom it was permissible, and to whom it
should be forbidden. But I pressed my lips even more tightly
together and held back the words. Instead I held out the ten
pound note to him. He kept his head bent downwards, his
eyes seemed to stray far away, as he put out his hand and
took it from me.
* * *
From that day onwards I ceased to bend my head or to look
away. I walked through the streets with my head held high,
and my eyes looking straight ahead. I looked people in the
eyes, and if I saw someone count his money, I ﬁxed it with
an unwinking gaze. I continued to walk the streets. The sun
was on my back. It ﬂowed through me with its rays. The
warmth of good food ran through my body with the blood in
my veins. The rest of the ten pound note nestled safely in
my pocket. My footsteps on the dark tarmac road struck the
ground with force, with a new elation, like the elation of a
child that has just pulled a toy to pieces and discovered the
secret of how it works.
A man came up to me and whispered. I looked him
straight in the eye and said ‘No.’ Another man came up to
me and muttered something in a secretive voice which
could barely be heard. I examined him carefully from head
to toes and said, ‘No.’ He enquired: ‘Why no?’ I replied:
‘Because there are plenty of men and I want to choose with
whom to go.’
So he said, ‘Well then, why not choose me?’
‘Because your ﬁnger nails are dirty, and I like them to be
clean.
A third man approached. He pronounced the secret word,
the key to the riddle I had solved. I asked,
‘How much will you pay?’
‘Ten pounds.’
‘No, twenty.’
‘Your wishes are my orders,’ and he paid me on the spot.
* * *
How many were the years of my life that went by before my
body, and my self became really mine, to do with them as I
wished? How many were the years of my life that were lost
before I tore my body and my self away from the people
who held me in their grasp since the very ﬁrst day? Now I
could decide on the food I wanted to eat, the house I
preferred to live in, refuse the man for whom I felt an
aversion no matter what the reason, and choose the man I
wished to have, even if it was only because he was clean
and well manicured. A quarter of a century had passed, for I
was twenty-ﬁve years old when I ﬁrst started to have a
clean apartment of my own, overlooking the main street,
engage a cook who prepared the food I ordered, and employ
someone to arrange for my appointments at the hours
which suited me, and in accordance with the terms which I
considered acceptable. My bank account kept mounting all
the time. I now had free time in which I could relax, go for
walks, or to the cinema, or the theatre, time to read the
newspapers and to discuss politics with the few close friends
I selected from the many who hovered around me seeking
to strike up a friendship.
One of my friends was called Di’aa. He was a journalist, or
a writer, or something of the sort. I preferred him to my
other friends because he was a man of culture, and I had
developed a liking for culture, ever since I had started to go
to school and had learned to read, but especially during this
last period, since I could now buy books. I had a large library
in my apartment, and it was here that I spent most of my
free time. On the walls I had hung some good paintings, and
right in the middle was my secondary school certiﬁcate
surrounded by an expensive frame. I never received anyone
in the library. It was a very special room reserved for me
alone. My bedroom was where I received my guests. The
ﬁrst time Di’aa came to my house, before I had time to lift
the embroidered quilt which covered my bed, he said,
‘Wait a moment, let’s talk to one another for a while. I
prefer talking to anything else.’
I was facing the bed with my back to him, so I did not see
his expression when he pronounced these words. But his
voice in my ear had a diﬀerent tone, a tone I had never
heard in the other men’s voices.
I turned round so that I could see his face. I was not in the
habit of turning round in order to look at the man’s face. I
would lift the embroidered quilt oﬀ the bed without looking
at him, without even trying to glimpse something of his
features. I used to keep my eyes tightly closed all the time
and only open them when the weight pressing down on me
had lifted from my body.
I turned round, raised my head, and looked straight into
his face. I could see that his features, like his voice, had
something about them that I had never come across before.
His head seemed too big for his body, and his eyes looked
small relative to his face. His skin was dark, but his eyes
were not black, although I was not able to distinguish their
exact colour in the dimmed electric light. His wide forehead
started high up and swept down to a small nose. Below the
nose his upper lip was shaven, and the thinning hair looked
scanty on the overlarge head.
Since I stood there facing him without saying a word, he
thought I had not heard him. He repeated:
‘Let’s talk a little. I prefer talking to anything else.’
‘Nevertheless you will have to pay me like they all do. The
time you can spend with me is ﬁxed, and every minute
counts as money.’
‘You make me feel I’m in a clinic. Why don’t you hang up a
price list in the waiting room? Do you also have emergency
visits?’
There was a note of irony in his voice, but I could not see
why, so I said,
‘Are you being sarcastic about my work, or about the
medical profession?’
‘Both,’ he said.
‘Are they similar to one another?’
‘Yes,’ he said, ‘except that a doctor while carrying out his
duties feels he’s worthy of respect.’
‘What about me?’ I exclaimed.
‘You are not respectable,’ he replied, but before the words
‘not respectable’ had even reached my ears, my hands rose
to cover them quickly, but they penetrated into my head
like the sharp tip of a plunging dagger. He closed his lips
tightly. A sudden deep silence enveloped the room, but the
words continued to echo in my ears, took refuge in their
innermost depths, buried themselves in my head, like some
palpable material object, like a body as sharp as the edge of
a knife which had cut its way through my ears, and the
bones of my head to the brain inside.
My hands were still raised to cover my ears and shut out
the sound of his voice. His voice was no longer audible to
me, and when he spoke I could not see the movement of his
lips, as though they remained invisible. The words seemed
to emerge from between them, to escape of their own
accord. I could almost see them as they traversed the space
separating his lips from my ears, like tangible things with a
well-deﬁned surface, exactly like blobs of spit, as though he
had aimed them at me from between his lips.
When he tried to brush his lips against mine, his words
were still resonating in my mind. I pushed him away from
me and said,
‘My work is not worthy of respect. Why then do you join in
it with me?’
He tried to take me by force, but I repelled his advances,
then went to the door and opened it, and he immediately
left.
But although Di’aa went out of my house, his words did
not leave my ears with him that night. They had cut their
way through to my mind in a moment of time which now
belonged to the past. But no force on earth could turn back
the hands of time one single moment. Before that moment
my mind had been calm, tranquil, undisturbed. Every night I
used to lay my head on the pillow and sleep deeply, right
through the night until morning. But now my head vibrated
with an incessant movement that kept on without respite,
throughout the day, and throughout the night, like the ebb
and ﬂow of waves on a shore, seething and foaming and
bubbling like boiling water. A sound like the roar of an angry
sea went back and forth from my ears to the pillow, and
from the pillow to my ears. In this storm I could no longer
tell which was the rushing sound of the sea, and which was
the blowing sound of the wind, for everything had become
just a series of blows which followed one another like night
and day, like my heartbeats racing in a row like a hammer in
my head ringing out one phrase with every blow: ‘not
respectable’, ‘not respectable’, hammering it out, blow after
blow, into my bones, outside my bones, over my bed, on the
ﬂoor, in the dining room, on the stairs, in the streets, on the
walls. Wherever I went the strokes of the hammer beat
down on my head, on my face, on my body, on my bones.
Wherever I went the words clung to me cold and sticky like
spit, like the spit of an insult echoing in the ear, like the spit
of insolent eyes over my naked body, like the spit of all the
degrading words I had heard ringing in my ears at one or
other time, like the spit of all the brazen eyes that
undressed me and examined my nakedness with a slow
insolence, like the spit of courteous eyes that looked aside
as I shed my clothes, hiding their contempt under a
respectful guise.
One phrase, one small phrase composed of two words,
threw a glaring light on the whole of my life, and made me
see it as it really was. The veil was torn from my eyes. I was
opening them for the ﬁrst time, seeing my life in a new way.
I was not a respected woman. It was something I had not
known before. It was as well that I had remained ignorant of
the fact. I was able to eat well, and sleep deeply. Was there
any way of uprooting this new knowledge from my mind?
After all, it was only like some pain, cutting with the sharp
edge of a knife through my head. In fact, it was not even a
knife, but only a small phrase composed of two words, a
small phrase which had penetrated like an arrow into my
brain before I had the time to clap my hands over my ears
and keep it out. Was there anything that could uproot it
from my head the way they extract a bullet, or excise a
tumour of the brain?
* * *
Nothing in the world seemed capable of making me the
same woman I had been before I heard the two words
pronounced by the man that night. From that moment
onwards I became another woman. My previous life was
behind me. I did not want to go back to it at any price, no
matter what torture and suﬀering I might have to go
through, even if I were to know hunger and cold, and utter
destitution. Come what may, I had to become a respectable
woman, even if the price were to be my life. I was prepared
to do anything to put a stop to the insults that my ears had
grown used to hearing, to keep the brazen eyes from
running all over my body.
I still had my secondary school certiﬁcate, my certiﬁcate
of merit, and a sharp decisive mind determined to ﬁnd
respectable work. I still had two black eyes that looked
people straight in the face and were ready to counter the
shifty, leering glances thrown at me as I made my way
through life. Every time there was an advertisement I
applied for the job. I went to all the ministries, departments,
and company oﬃces where there might be a vacancy. And
ﬁnally, by dint of these eﬀorts, I at last found a job with one
of the big industrial concerns.
Now I had a small oﬃce of my own, separated from the
chairman’s spacious room by a small door. Above the door
protruded a red light, and near it was a bell. When the bell
rang I would push open the door and enter his room. There
he sat behind his desk, a man of about ﬁfty, fat and bald,
smoking all day. Some of his teeth were missing, and those
that remained were stained yellow with black patches. He
would look up from his papers with a cigarette dangling
from his lips and say,
‘Today I’m out for everybody except the really top
people.Understood?’
And before I could ask him what he meant by ‘the really
top people’ his head would bend over his papers once more,
and almost disappear in the clouds of cigarette smoke.
After the day’s work was over, I would pick up my little
bag and go home. What I called home was not a house, or a
ﬂat, but merely a small room without a toilet. I rented it
from an old woman who got up every morning at dawn to
pray, then knocked at my door. My work did not start until
eight o’clock in the morning, but I was always up at ﬁve, so
that I would have the time to take my towel, and go down to
join the queue of men and women standing in front of the
bathroom. For my meagre salary did not permit me to live
anywhere else than in this house, situated in a narrow back
street with rows of small shops where plumbers and
blacksmiths plied their trade. I had to wind my way through
several narrow streets and walk up part of the main road
before reaching the bus stop. When the bus came to a halt
every one of the men and women at the stop would struggle
to push his way in. I would join the throng of jostling,
ﬁghting bodies. But once inside it was as though I had
stepped into an oven, where the packed bodies had fused
into a single mass.
The building of the company where I worked had two
doors: one for the more important higher level employees
which remained unguarded, and another for the lesser
oﬃcials which was guarded by one of the employees, very
much like some kind of a doorkeeper. He used to sit behind
a little desk with a big register in front of him. The
employees signed in the register when they arrived in the
morning or left after the day’s work was over. I used to run
down the long list for my name and sign opposite it. Then
next to my name the man would write down the exact time,
to the minute, of my arrival. When I left at the end of the
day, he would register my departure time with the same
precision.
But the higher oﬃcials would come and go as they
pleased. They all rode in cars, big or small. I used to glimpse
them sitting in their cars as I stood on one leg in the bus,
hemmed in by a mass of bodies. One day, as I was running
after the bus, trying to ﬁnd a foothold on to which I could
jump, one of them saw me. His look was that of a top
executive to a minor oﬃcial. I felt it land on my head, and
then drop down to my body like cold water, the blood
rushed to my head, and my foot tripped over something, so
I came to a sudden stop. He drove up to where I stood and
said,
‘I can give you a lift.’
I looked into his eyes. They clearly said, ‘You’re a poor,
miserable employee, unworthy of esteem, running after a
bus to catch it. I’ll take you in my car because your female
body has aroused me. It is an honour for you to be desired
by a respected oﬃcial like myself. And who knows, maybe
some day in the future, I can help you to get a rise before
the others.’
When I said nothing, he thought I had not heard him. So
he repeated: ‘I can give you a lift.’
I quietly replied, ‘The price of my body is much higher
than the price that can be paid for it with a pay rise.’
His eyes widened with surprise. Maybe he was wondering
how it was that I had read his thoughts so easily. I watched
him as he drove oﬀ at high speed.
* * *
After I had spent three years in the company, I realized that
as a prostitute I had been looked upon with more respect,
and been valued more highly than all the female
employees, myself included. In those days I lived in a house
with a private toilet. I could enter it at any time, and lock
the door on myself without anybody hurrying me. My body
was never hemmed in by other bodies in the bus, nor was it
a prey to male organs pressing up against it from in front
and behind. Its price was not cheap, and could not be paid
for by a mere rise in salary, an invitation to dinner, a drive
along the Nile in somebody’s car. Nor was it considered the
price I was supposed to pay in order to gain my director’s
good will, or avoid the chairman’s anger.
Throughout those three years not once did a top executive
or higher oﬃcial so much as touch me. I had no wish to
humiliate my body at a low price, especially after I had
become accustomed to being paid very highly for whatever
services I rendered. I even refused invitations to lunch, or to
a drive along the Nile. After a long day’s work, I preferred to
go home and sleep. I felt sorry for the other girls who were
guileless enough to oﬀer their bodies and their physical
eﬀorts every night in return for a meal, or a good yearly
report, or just to ensure that they would not be treated
unfairly, or discriminated against, or transferred. Every time
one of the directors made me a proposition, I would say to
him,
‘It’s not that I value my honour and my reputation more
than the other girls, but my price is much higher than
theirs.’
I came to realize that a female employee is more afraid of
losing her job than a prostitute is of losing her life. An
employee is scared of losing her job and becoming a
prostitute because she does not understand that the
prostitute’s life is in fact better than hers. And so she pays
the price of her illusory fears with her life, her health, her
body, and her mind. She pays the highest price for things of
the lowest value. I now knew that all of us were prostitutes
who sold themselves at varying prices, and that an
expensive prostitute was better than a cheap one. I also
knew that if I lost my job, all I would lose with it was the
miserable salary, the contempt I could read every day in the
eyes of the higher level executives when they looked at the
lesser female oﬃcials, the humiliating pressure of male
bodies on mine when I rode in the bus, and the long
morning queue in front of a perpetually overﬂowing toilet.
I was not too keen on keeping my job, and perhaps for
that very reason the company authorities seemed to
become more and more keen to keep me. I did not make
any special eﬀort to curry the favour of one or other of the
higher oﬃcials. On the contrary, it was they who started
vying with one another for my favours. And so the word
went round that I was an honourable woman, and a highly
respected oﬃcial, in fact the most honourable, and the most
highly considered of all the female oﬃcials in the company.
It was also said that none of the men had succeeded in
breaking my pride and that not a single high-ranking oﬃcial
had been able to make me bow my head, or lower my eyes
to the ground.
But I liked my job despite everything. At work I met my
women colleagues. I could talk to them and they could talk
to me. My oﬃce was better than the room in which I lived.
There was no queue outside the oﬃce toilets, and nobody
hurried me when I was inside. The grounds around the oﬃce
building had a small garden in which I could sit for a while at
the end of the day before going home. Sometimes night
would fall and I would still be there, in no hurry to return to
my dreary room, the dirty back streets and the foul smelling
toilets.
* * *
One day as I sat there one of the employees saw me. For a
moment he was scared by the sight of a dark mass, the size
of a human body, crouched motionless in the dark of night.
He called out from a distance:
‘Who is it? Who is sitting there?’
I said in a sad voice, ‘It’s me, Firdaus.’
When he came nearer he recognized me, and seemed
surprised to see me sitting there alone, for I was considered
one of the best employees in the company, and the best
employees were expected to leave immediately the day’s
work was over.
I said I was having a rest because I felt tired. He sat down
next to me. His name was Ibrahim. He was a short, stocky
man, with rather fuzzy black hair, and black eyes. I could
see them in the night looking at me, and felt that they were
able to see me despite the dark. Every time I moved my
head away they followed me, held on fast refusing to let go.
Even when I hid my eyes behind my hands they seemed to
pierce through them to what was there behind. But after a
while he took hold of my hands, gently pulled them away
from my face, and said,
‘Firdaus, I beg of you. Don’t cry.’
‘Let me cry,’ I said.
‘But I’ve never seen you cry before. What’s happened?’
‘Nothing… Nothing at all.’
‘That’s not possible. Something must have happened.’
‘Nothing at all has happened,’ I repeated.
He sounded surprised. ‘Are you crying for nothing?’
‘I do not know why I am crying. Nothing new had
happened in my life.’
He remained seated by my side in silence. His black eyes
wandered into the night, and the tears welled up in them for
a moment with a glistening light. He tightened his lips and
swallowed hard, and suddenly the light in his eyes went out.
Then they started to shine again, but an instant later went
dark, like tiny ﬂames snuﬀed out in the night. He kept
pressing his lips together and swallowing hard, but at last I
saw two tears overﬂow from his eyes, and drop down on
either side. He hid his face with one hand, pulled out a
handkerchief with the other, and wiped his nose.
‘Are you crying, Ibrahim?’ I asked.
‘No, Firdaus.’
He hid the handkerchief, swallowed with an eﬀort and
smiled at me.
The courtyard around us was plunged in a deep silence.
There was not a sound to be heard and everything was
motionless, suspended, without movement. The sky above
was enveloped in darkness with not a ray of light from sun
or moon. My face was turned towards his face, and my eyes
looked into his eyes. I could see two rings of pure white
surrounding two circles of intense black looking out at me. I
continued to gaze into them. The white seemed to grow
even whiter, and the black to become even blacker, as
though light ﬂowed through them from some unknown,
mysterious source, neither on earth, nor in the heavens, for
the earth was enveloped in the dark cloak of night, and the
heavens had neither sun nor moon to light them up.
I held his eyes fast in mine. I reached out and took his
hand in mine. The feel of our hands touching was strange,
sudden. It made my body tremble with a deep, distant
pleasure, older than the age of remembered life, deeper
than the consciousness carried within me throughout. I
could feel it somewhere in my being, like a part which had
been born with me when I was born, but had not grown with
me when I had grown. Or like something I had known before
being born, and left behind.
At that moment a memory came back to me and my lips
parted to express it in words, but my voice failed to emerge,
as though no sooner did I remember than I had already
forgotten it. My heart faltered, overcome by its frightened,
almost frenzied beating because of something I had just
lost, or was on the point of losing for ever. My ﬁngers
grasped at his hand with such violence that no force in the
world, no matter how great, could take it away from me.
* * *
After that night we only had to meet and my lips would part
to say something. But no sooner did I remember it than it
was already forgotten. My heart beat with fear, or with an
emotion akin to fear. I wanted to reach out and take his
hand, but he would enter the premises and leave them
without noticing me, and if he looked at me it was in the
same way that he looked at any other female employee.
At a big meeting for the workers I heard him speak about
justice and the abolition of privileges enjoyed by
management as compared to the workers. We applauded
him enthusiastically and stood at the door for a long time to
shake his hand. When my turn came I held his hand in mine,
and his eyes in my eyes for a long moment. Sitting at my
desk I would absent-mindedly jot down his name ‘Ibrahim’
on the wooden surface, or on the back of my hand, and no
sooner did I glimpse him crossing the inner courtyard, than I
would stand up as though getting ready to rush oﬀ and join
him. But a moment later I would sit down again. My friend,
Fatheya, caught me standing up and sitting down again like
that several times. She came up to me and whispered into
my ear:
‘What’s happened to you, Firdaus?’
And I would question in a musing voice, ‘Has Ibrahim
forgotten?’
‘Forgotten what?’ she would say.
‘I don’t know, Fatheya.’
‘You’re living in a dream world, my dear girl.’
‘That’s not true. That’s not true, Fatheya. It happened.’
Then she would ask, ‘What is it exactly that happened?’
I tried to tell her what had happened, but did not know
how to describe it to her, or maybe I could not ﬁnd anything
to say, as if something had happened, but I had forgotten
exactly what it was, or as if nothing had happened at all.
I would close my eyes, and try to bring back the scene.
The two circles of deep black surrounded by two rings of
intense white would gradually appear before my eyes. When
I stared into them for some time, they would start to
expand, rapidly becoming bigger and bigger, so that at a
certain moment the black reached the size of the earth, and
the white grew into a piercingly white mass, as big as the
disc of the sun. My eyes would lose themselves in the black
and the white until they could no longer perceive either of
them. The images before my eyes grew confused. I could no
longer distinguish between the faces of my mother and my
father, of Wafeya and Fatheya, of Iqbal and Ibrahim. I
opened my eyes wide in panic, like someone threatened
with losing her sight. The outlines of Fatheya’s face were
still there, standing out against the dark colour of the earth,
or the shining white of the sun.
‘Do you love Ibrahim?’ she asked.
‘Not at all.’
‘Why then do you tremble whenever you hear his name
mentioned?’
‘Me? Never! It has never happened. You always
exaggerate, Fatheya.’
I heard her say, ‘Ibrahim is a ﬁne man, and a
revolutionary.’
‘I know. But I am no more than a minor employee. How
could Ibrahim possibly fall in love with a poor girl like me?’
* * *
A revolutionary committee was set up in the company, with
Ibrahim as its chairman. I joined the committee and started
to work for it day and night, including holidays. It was
voluntary work. I no longer worried about my wages.
Waiting in the morning queue for the toilet no longer
bothered me, and the pressure of bodies surrounding me no
longer ﬁlled me with humiliation. One day Ibrahim saw me
running after the bus, stopped his small car and called out
to me. I got in next to him. A moment later I heard him say,
‘I admire you, Firdaus. If we had just ﬁve people in the
company with your zeal, energy and conviction, we could do
almost anything in the world.’
I said nothing. I was pressing my little bag against my
breast, trying to cover up the pounding of my heart, and to
make my breathing return to normal. But after a while I
realized that my breathing was still hectic. In an attempt to
conceal the emotion I felt, I proﬀered an excuse which
sounded rather lame:
‘I’m still out of breath from chasing that bus.’
He must have realized what I was trying to do, for he just
smiled without making any comment. After a while he asked
me,
‘Do you want to go straight home or shall we sit
somewhere and talk?’
The question took me by surprise and I answered on the
spur of the moment without thinking,
‘I don’t want to go home.’ Then in order to cover up the
slip I had made, I added quickly, ‘You must be tired after a
long day’s work. Perhaps you had better go straight home
and rest.’
‘Maybe it will do me more good to talk to you for a while.
That’s, of course, if you are not tired yourself and would
prefer to rest at home.’
Almost unaware of what I was saying, I replied, ‘Rest! I
have never known what it means to rest in my life.’
I felt his strong warm hand take hold of mine. I felt myself
trembling all through. Even the roots of the hair on my body
seemed to move.
He asked in a quiet voice, ‘Firdaus. Do you remember the
ﬁrst time we met?’
‘Yes.’
‘Ever since that day I have been thinking about you.’
‘And I, too, have been thinking about you.’
‘I have been trying to hide my feelings, but it’s no longer
possible.’
‘So have I.’
That day we talked about everything. I described my
childhood, and what had happened to my life in the past,
and he, too, spoke to me of his childhood years and the
dreams he had for the future. The next day we met again
and talked even more freely about everything. I even spoke
to him about things I had hidden from myself, and refused
to face. And he, in turn, was very frank with me, and hid
nothing. On the third day he took me to his small house and
I spent the night with him. We talked very quietly for a long
time and when we had said all we had to say, we gave
ourselves to one another in a warm embrace.
It was as though I held the whole world captive in my
hands. It seemed to grow bigger, to expand, and the sun
shone brighter than ever before. Everything around me
ﬂoated in a radiant light, even the morning queue in front of
the toilet. The eyes of the people riding in the buses no
longer looked dull and jaundiced, but glowed and shone with
a new light. When I looked into the mirror my eyes sparkled
like diamonds. My body had become like a feather, and I
could work all day without tiring, or feeling a need to sleep.
One morning a colleague of mine in the oﬃce stared at
my face, and then exclaimed with a note of wonderment in
her voice: ‘What’s going on, Firdaus?’
‘Why?’ I enquired.
‘Your face is not the same.’
‘What do you mean, not the same?’
‘It’s as though it’s radiating some inner glow.’
‘I’m in love.’
‘In love?’
‘Do you know what it is to love?’ I asked.
‘No,’ she said sadly.
‘You poor thing,’ said I.
‘You poor, deluded woman,’ said she, ‘do you believe
there is any such thing as love?’
‘Love has made me a diﬀerent person. It has made the
world beautiful.’
There was a deep note of sadness in her voice as she
spoke. ‘You’re living an illusion. Do you believe the words of
love they whisper in the ears of penniless women like us?’
‘But he’s a revolutionary. He’s ﬁghting for us and for all
those who are deprived of a decent life.’
‘You are really to be pitied. Do you think that what they
say in their meetings is true?’
‘That’s enough,’ I said angrily. ‘You wear dark glasses over
your eyes and then say you cannot see the sunshine.’
The sun was on my face. I gazed at the light and warmth
around me, basking in it with wonder as I watched him cross
the courtyard at the usual hour. His eyes sparkled in the
sunshine with a strange new brilliance. They looked diﬀerent
to me, like the eyes of another man, and I felt estranged. I
ran up to him but there was a group of employees gathered
around him, men and women, shaking his hand and
congratulating him. He did not see me in the crowd. I heard
words that rang in my ears with a strange resonance:
‘He got engaged to the chairman’s daughter yesterday.
He’s a clever lad, and deserves whatever good fortune may
come to him. He has a bright future to look forward to, and
will rise quickly in the company.’
I put my hands over my ears to shut out the sound of their
voices. I walked away from the happy throng around him,
and left through the company gate, but did not go home.
I walked round and round in the streets. My eyes could
see nothing, for the tears kept ﬂowing from them, drying up
now and then for a short while, only to start ﬂowing once
more. When night fell I was completely exhausted. All of a
sudden my tears ceased to ﬂow, as though something had
closed up inside. Soon my face and neck became dry, but
the front of my bodice was soaking wet. The cold night air
penetrated to my body. I shivered and wound my arms
around my chest to try and keep warm. I remembered his
arms around me and shivered even more. I wept but the
tears had dried once and for all. I heard a sound like that of
a woman sobbing and realized that the voice I could hear
was mine.
That night I went back to the company premises. I went
into my oﬃce, collected my papers, put them in a small bag
and then walked to the main door. Since I heard the news in
the morning I had not seen Ibrahim again. I hesitated at the
entrance for a moment and looked around slowly. My eyes
wandered to the little garden in the back yard. I walked
towards it and sat down. I kept looking around me all the
time. Whenever I heard a sound coming from a distance, or
sensed some movement or other, I strained my ears and my
eyes. I saw a shape about the size of a human body moving
near the entrance to the courtyard. I jumped to my feet. My
heart beat wildly, the blood started pounding through my
chest, up to my head. It seemed to me that the shape was
moving towards me. I felt myself walking to meet it. My
body was bathed in sweat. My head and the palms of my
hands felt wet. A twinge of fear went through me as I moved
across the dark courtyard. I called out in a voice so faint
that it fell short of my ears:
‘Ibrahim.’
But the silence remained as deep as before. I became
even more frightened, for I could still see what looked like a
human shape in the night. I called out again, this time in a
loud voice that I could now hear:
‘Who’s there?’
It was as if the loud voice dispelled the dream like
someone talking in his sleep is awakened by the sound of
his own voice. The darkness lifted to reveal a brick wall
which had been built in front of the entrance to the
courtyard. It was a low wall, the height of an average man,
built of bare bricks without any plaster. Although I had seen
it before it seemed to have sprung up in front of my eyes at
that very moment.
Before I went out through the gate, I looked around me
once more. My eyes swept the windows, the doors, and the
walls, searching for something to open suddenly and reveal
his eyes for a moment, or his hand waving the usual
farewell. My eyes kept moving restlessly. At every moment I
would lose all hope, only to regain it a moment later. My
eyes would resume their frenzied search, and my breast
would heave up and down more deeply. Before stepping out
into the street I paused for a last moment, standing
motionless in the dark. Even as I walked down the street I
continued to turn round as though expecting something to
happen, but the windows and doors remained as tightly shut
as before.
* * *
I had never experienced suﬀering such as this, never felt a
deeper pain. When I was selling my body to men the pain
had been much less. It was imaginary, rather than real. As a
prostitute I was not myself, my feelings did not arise from
within me. They were not really mine. Nothing could really
hurt me and make me suﬀer then the way I was suﬀering
now. Never had I felt so humiliated as I felt this time.
Perhaps as a prostitute I had known so deep a humiliation
that nothing really counted. When the street becomes your
life, you no longer expect anything, hope for anything. But I
expected something from love. With love I began to imagine
that I had become a human being. When I was a prostitute I
never gave anything for nothing, but always took something
in return. But in love I gave my body and my soul, my mind
and all the eﬀort I could muster, freely. I never asked for
anything, gave everything I had, abandoned myself totally,
dropped all my weapons, lowered all my defences, and
bared my ﬂesh. But when I was a prostitute I protected
myself, fought back at every moment, was never oﬀ guard.
To protect my deeper, inner self from men, I oﬀered them
only an outer shell. I kept my heart and soul, and let my
body play its role, its passive, inert, unfeeling role. I learnt to
resist by being passive, to keep myself whole by oﬀering
nothing, to live by withdrawing to a world of my own. In
other words, I was telling the man he could have my body,
he could have a dead body, but he would never be able to
make me react, or tremble, or feel either pleasure or pain. I
made no eﬀort, expended no energy, gave no aﬀection,
provided no thought. I was therefore never tired or
exhausted. But in love I gave all: my capabilities, my eﬀorts,
my feelings, my deepest emotions. Like a saint, I gave
everything I had without ever counting the cost. I wanted
nothing, nothing at all, except perhaps one thing. To be
saved through love from it all. To ﬁnd myself again, to
recover the self I had lost. To become a human being who
was not looked upon with scorn, or despised, but respected,
and cherished and made to feel whole.
I was not destined to achieve what I had hoped for. For no
matter how hard I tried, or what sacriﬁces I made like some
dreamer sold to a cause, I still remained a poor insigniﬁcant
employee. My virtue, like the virtue of all those who are
poor, could never be considered a quality, or an asset, but
rather was looked upon as a kind of stupidity, or simple-
mindedness, to be despised even more than depravity or
vice.
* * *
The time had come for me to shed the last grain of virtue,
the last drop of sanctity in my blood. Now I was aware of the
reality, of the truth. Now I knew what I wanted. Now there
was no room for illusions. A successful prostitute was better
than a misled saint. All women are victims of deception.
Men impose deception on women and punish them for being
deceived, force them down to the lowest level and punish
them for falling so low, bind them in marriage and then
chastise them with menial service for life, or insults, or
blows.
Now I realized that the least deluded of all women was the
prostitute. That marriage was the system built on the most
cruel suﬀering for women.
* * *
It was midnight and the streets were quiet. A gentle breeze
was beckoning softly from the Nile. I walked along, enjoying
the peace of the night. I no longer felt any pain. Everything
around seemed to ﬁll me with tranquillity. The gentle breeze
caressing my face, the empty streets, and the rows of
closed windows and doors, the feeling of being rejected by
people and at the same time being able to reject them, the
estrangement from everything, even the earth, and the sky
and the trees. I was like a woman walking through an
enchanted world to which she does not belong. She is free
to do what she wants, and free not to do it. She experiences
the rare pleasure of having no ties with anyone, of having
broken with everything, of having cut all relations with the
world around her, of being completely independent and
living her independence completely, of enjoying freedom
from any subjection to a man, to marriage, or to love; of
being divorced from all limitations whether rooted in rules
and laws in time or in the universe. If the ﬁrst man who
comes along does not want her, she will have the next, or
the one after. No need to wait any longer for just one man.
No need to be sad when he does not turn up, or to expect
anything and suﬀer when one’s hopes are razed to the
ground. She no longer hopes for anything or desires
anything. She no longer fears anything, for everything which
can hurt her she has already undergone.
* * *
My arms opened wide to embrace the night, and my voice
started to hum a song I vaguely remembered having heard
before:
I hope for nothing
I want for nothing
I fear nothing
I am free.
A magniﬁcent, long-bonneted car pulled up in front of me.
When the man looked out of the window I laughed. In the
soft luxurious bed, I turned over from one side to the other,
but neither made any eﬀort, nor experienced any pleasure
or pain. As I turned over in the bed a thought ﬂashed
through my mind. Revolutionary men with principles were
not really diﬀerent from the rest. They used their cleverness
to get, in return for principles, what other men buy with
their money. Revolution for them is like sex for us.
Something to be abused. Something to be sold.
* * *
I met Ibrahim by accident four years after he married. He
wanted to come with me to my ﬂat. I had not yet got over
my love for him, so I refused. I would not prostitute myself
with him. But several years after that I gave in to his
insistence, and agreed to let him come to my place. He was
on the point of leaving without making any gesture to show
that he intended to pay me.
I said, ‘You’ve forgotten to pay me.’
He took a ten pound note out of his wallet with trembling
ﬁngers, and gave it to me.
‘My rate is not less than twenty pounds,’ I explained, then
added, ‘sometimes it is even more.’
His hand started to tremble again as he extracted another
ten pound note from the wallet. I realized that he had not
really been in love with me, but came to me every night
only because he did not have to pay.
* * *
I became aware of the fact that I hated men, but for long
years had hidden this secret carefully. The men I hated most
of all were those who tried to give me advice, or told me
that they wanted to rescue me from the life I was leading. I
used to hate them more than the others because they
thought they were better than I was and could help me
change my life. They saw themselves in some kind of
chivalrous role – a role they had failed to play under other
circumstances. They wanted to feel noble and elevated by
reminding me of the fact that I was low. They were saying to
themselves:
‘See how wonderful I am. I’m trying to lift her out of the
mud before it’s too late, that slut of a woman.’
I refused to give them a chance to play this role. None of
them was there to rescue me when I was married to a man
who beat me up and kicked me every day. And not one of
them came to my help when my heart was broken because I
had dared to fall in love. A woman’s life is always miserable.
A prostitute, however, is a little better oﬀ. I was able to
convince myself that I had chosen this life of my own free
will. The fact that I rejected their noble attempts to save
me, my insistence on remaining a prostitute, proved to me
this was my choice and that I had some freedom, at least
the freedom to live in a situation better than that of other
women.
* * *
A prostitute always says yes, and then names her price. If
she says no she ceases to be a prostitute. I was not a
prostitute in the full sense of the word, so from time to time
I said no. As a result my price kept going up. A man cannot
stand being rejected by a woman, because deep down
inside he feels a rejection of himself. No one can stand this
double rejection. And so every time I said no, the man would
insist. No matter how high I raised the price he could not
stand being refused by a woman.
I became a very successful prostitute. I was paid the
highest price, and even men of great importance competed
for my favours. One day a very important personality from a
foreign state heard about me. He arranged things in such a
way that he could look me over without my noticing.
Immediately after he sent for me, but I refused to go. I knew
that successful politicians cannot bear to accept defeat in
front of others, probably because they always carry defeat
within themselves. A human being cannot stand up to a
double defeat. That is the secret of their continuous attempt
to rise to power. They draw a feeling of supremacy from
their power over others. It makes them feel victorious rather
than defeated. It hides how essentially hollow they are
inside, despite the impression of greatness they try to
spread around them, which is all they really care for.
My refusal made him even more intent on gaining a
victory over me. Every day he would send me a man from
the police, and each time this man would try a diﬀerent
approach. But I continued to refuse. Once he oﬀered me
money. On another occasion he threatened me with prison.
On still a third, he explained to me that refusing a Head of
State could be looked upon as an insult to a great man and
lead to strained relations between the two countries. He
added that if I really loved my country, if I was a patriot, I
would go to him at once. So I told the man from the police
that I knew nothing about patriotism, that my country had
not only given me nothing, but had also taken away
anything I might have had, including my honour and my
dignity. I was surprised to see that the man from the police
looked as though his moral pride was greatly shaken by
what I had said. How could anyone be devoid of patriotic
feeling? I felt like exploding with laughter at the ridiculous
stance he was taking, the paradox he personiﬁed, his
double moral standards. He wanted to take a prostitute to
this important personality’s bed, like any common pimp
would do, and yet talk in digniﬁed tones of patriotism and
moral principles. But I realized that the man from the police
was only obeying orders, and that any order issued to him
was elevated to a sacred national duty. Whether he took me
to prison, or to an important man’s bed, it was just the same
to him. In both cases, he was fulﬁlling a sacred national
duty. Where national duty was concerned, a prostitute could
be awarded the highest honours, and murder could become
an act of heroism.
I refused to go to men of this sort. My body was my
property alone, but the land of our country was theirs to
own. On one occasion they put me in prison because I
turned down one of these important men. So I hired a very
big lawyer, for a very big sum of money. Shortly after, I was
released from gaol without charges. The court decided I was
an honourable woman. Now I had learnt that honour
required large sums of money to protect it, but that large
sums of money could not be obtained without losing one’s
honour. An infernal circle whirling round and round, dragging
me up and down with it.
* * *
Yet not for a single moment did I have any doubts about my
own integrity and honour as a woman. I knew that my
profession had been invented by men, and that men were in
control of both our worlds, the one on earth, and the one in
heaven. That men force women to sell their bodies at a
price, and that the lowest paid body is that of a wife. All
women are prostitutes of one kind or another. Because I was
intelligent I preferred to be a free prostitute, rather than an
enslaved wife. Every time I gave my body I charged the
highest price. I could employ any number of servants to
wash my clothes and clean my shoes, hire a lawyer no
matter how expensive to defend my honour, pay a doctor
for an abortion, buy a journalist to publish my picture and
write something about me in the newspapers. Everybody
has a price, and every profession is paid a salary. The more
respectable the profession, the higher the salary, and a
person’s price goes up as he climbs the social ladder. One
day, when I donated some money to a charitable
association, the newspapers published pictures of me and
sang my praises as the model of a citizen with a sense of
civic responsibility. And so from then on, whenever I needed
a dose of honour or fame, I had only to draw some money
from the bank.
* * *
But male noses have an uncanny way of sniﬃng out money.
And so one day a man came along and asked me to marry
him. I refused. The imprint of my husband’s shoe was still
there on my body. Then came another one looking for love,
but I refused him too. Deep down inside of me there were
still vestiges of the old pain.
I thought I had escaped from men, but the man who came
this time practised a well-known male profession. He was a
pimp. I thought I could buy him oﬀ with a sum of money, the
way I did with the police. But he refused the money, and
insisted on sharing in my earnings. He said,
‘Every prostitute has a pimp to protect her from other
pimps, and from the police. That’s what I’m going to do.’
‘But I can protect myself,’ I said.
‘There isn’t a woman on earth who can protect herself.’
‘I don’t want your protection.’
‘You cannot do without protection, otherwise the
profession exercised by husbands and pimps would die out.’
‘I refuse your threats.’
‘But I’m not threatening you. I’m just giving you a little
advice.’
‘And if I don’t accept your advice?’
‘Then I may be obliged to threaten.’
‘How do you propose to threaten me?’
‘I have my own ways of doing things. Every craft has its
tools.’
I went to the police, only to discover that he had better
connections than I. Then I had recourse to legal
proceedings. I found out that the law punishes women like
me, but turns a blind eye to what men do.
And this man, this pimp whose name was Marzouk,
enjoyed a good laugh as he watched me from a distance,
striving in vain to ﬁnd some way of protecting myself from
him. One day he saw me entering my house and followed
me. I tried to shut the door in his face, but he took out a
knife, threatened me with it, and forced his way in.
‘What do you want of me?’ I asked.
‘I want to protect you from other men,’ he replied.
‘But no one else besides you is menacing me.’
‘If it isn’t me, it will be someone else. There are pimps
running around everywhere. If you want me to marry you,
I’m perfectly willing to do so.’
‘I don’t see the need for you to marry me as well. It’s
enough that you take what I earn. My body at least is mine.’
He went on like a successful businessman: ‘I’m in
business. My capital is women’s bodies and I don’t mix work
and love together.’
‘Do you know anything about love?’
‘Is there anyone who does not know what love is? Haven’t
you fallen in love at one time or another?’
‘I have.’
‘And now?’
‘It’s over, there’s nothing left. And you?’
‘It hasn’t died yet.’
‘Poor thing. How miserable you must be.’
‘I tried to get over it, but failed.’
‘Is it a man or a woman? Pimps usually prefer men.’
‘No, it’s a woman.’
‘Do you keep her?’
‘I’m giving her everything. My money, my mind, my body,
my being, my energy. Everything, and yet I feel that I do not
satisfy her, that she’s in love with another man.’
‘You poor thing.’
‘Everybody’s the same when it comes to love.’ He looked
straight into my eyes and said, ‘You’re living an illusion. I
can see in your eyes how love has broken the spirit that
used to shine.’
‘Love makes the eyes sparkle, it does not kill their shine.’
‘You poor thing. You’ve never really known what it is to be
in love. I’m going to teach you.’
He tried to pull me to him, but I pushed him away and
said,
‘I don’t mix work with love.’
‘Who said this is love. It’s just part of the job.’
‘Impossible.’
‘For me the word impossible does not exist.’
He wound his arms around me. I felt the familiar weight
pressing down on my breast, but my body withdrew, turned
in on itself away from me, like some passive, lifeless thing,
refusing to surrender, undefeated. Its passivity was a form
of resistance, a strange ability not to feel either pleasure or
pain, not to let a single hair on my head, or on my body, be
moved.
* * *
So he began to share in everything that I earned, in fact to
conﬁscate the larger part for himself. But each time he tried
to come near me, I pushed him away, repeating:
‘It’s impossible. It’s no use trying.’
Then he’d beat me up. And each time I would hear the
same phrase repeated as he struck me: ‘The word does not
exist for me.’
I discovered he was a dangerous pimp who controlled a
number of prostitutes, and I was one of them. He had
friends everywhere, in every profession, and on whom he
spent his money generously. He had a doctor friend to
whom he had recourse if one of his prostitutes became
pregnant and needed an abortion, a friend in the police who
protected him from raids, a friend in the courts who used his
legal knowledge and position to keep him out of trouble and
release any of the prostitutes who found herself in gaol, so
that she was not held up from earning money for too long.
I realized I was not nearly as free as I had hitherto
imagined myself to be. I was nothing but a body machine
working day and night so that a number of men belonging
to diﬀerent professions could become immensely rich at my
expense. I was no longer even mistress of the house for
which I had paid with my eﬀorts and sweat. One day I said
to myself,
‘I can’t go on like this.’
I packed my papers in a small bag and got ready to leave,
but suddenly he appeared, standing in front of me.
‘Where are you going?’ he asked.
‘I’m going to look for work. I still have my secondary
school certiﬁcate.’
‘And who said that you are not working?’
‘I want to choose the work I’m going to do.’
‘Who says anyone in this whole wide world chooses the
work he wants to do?’
‘I don’t want to be anybody’s slave.’
‘And who says there is anyone who is not someone else’s
slave? There are only two categories of people, Firdaus,
masters and slaves.’
‘In that case I want to be one of the masters and not one
of the slaves.’
‘How can you be one of the masters? A woman on her
own cannot be a master, let alone a woman who’s a
prostitute. Can’t you see you’re asking for the impossible?’
‘The word impossible does not exist for me,’ I said.
I tried to slip through the door, but he pushed me back
and shut it. I looked him in the eye and said, ‘I intend to
leave.’
He stared back at me. I heard him mutter, ‘You will never
leave.’
I continued to look straight at him without blinking. I knew
I hated him as only a woman can hate a man, as only a
slave can hate his master. I saw from the expression in his
eyes that he feared me as only a master can fear his slave,
as only a man can fear a woman. But it lasted for only a
second. Then the arrogant expression of the master, the
aggressive look of the male who fears nothing, returned. I
caught hold of the latch of the door to open it, but he lifted
his arm up in the air and slapped me. I raised my hand even
higher than he had done, and brought it down violently on
his face. The whites of his eyes went red. His hand started
to reach for the knife he carried in his pocket, but my hand
was quicker than his. I raised the knife and buried it deep in
his neck, pulled it out of his neck and then thrust it deep
into his chest, pulled it out of his chest and plunged it deep
into his belly. I stuck the knife into almost every part of his
body. I was astonished to ﬁnd how easily my hand moved as
I thrust the knife into his ﬂesh, and pulled it out almost
without eﬀort. My surprise was all the greater since I had
never done what I was doing before. A question ﬂashed
through my mind. Why was it that I had never stabbed a
man before? I realized that I had been afraid, and that the
fear had been within me all the time, until the ﬂeeting
moment when I read fear in his eyes.
* * *
I opened the door and walked down the stairs into the
street. My body was as light as a feather, as though its
weight had been nothing more than the accumulation of
fear over the years. The night was silent, the darkness ﬁlled
me with wonder, as though light had only been one illusion
after another dropping like veils over my eyes. The Nile had
something almost magical about it. The air was fresh,
invigorating. I walked down the street, my head held high to
the heavens, with the pride of having destroyed all masks to
reveal what is hidden behind. My footsteps broke the silence
with their steady rhythmic beat on the pavement. They
were neither fast as though I was hurrying away from
something in fear, nor were they slow. They were the
footsteps of a woman who believed in herself, knew where
she was going, and could see her goal. They were the
footsteps of a woman wearing expensive leather shoes, with
strong high heels, her feet arched in a feminine curve, rising
up to full rounded legs, with a smooth, taut skin and not a
single hair.
No one would have easily recognized me. I looked no
diﬀerent from respectable, upper-class women. My hair had
been done by a stylist who catered only for the rich. My lips
were painted in the natural tone preferred by respectable
women because it neither completely hides, nor completely
exposes their lust. My eyes were pencilled in perfect lines
drawn to suggest a seductive appeal, or a provocative
withdrawal. I looked no diﬀerent from the wife of an upper-
class government oﬃcial occupying a high position of
authority. But my ﬁrm, conﬁdent steps resounding on the
pavement proved that I was nobody’s wife.
I crossed by a number of men working in the police force,
but none of them realized who I was. Perhaps they thought I
was a princess, or a queen, or a goddess. For who else
would hold her head so high as she walked? And who else’s
footsteps could resound in this way as they struck the
ground? They watched me as I passed by, and I kept my
head high like a challenge to their lascivious eyes. I moved
along as calm as ice, my steps beating down with a steady
unfaltering sound. For I knew that they stood there waiting
for a woman like me to stumble, so that they could throw
themselves on her like birds of prey.
At the corner of the street I spotted a luxurious car, with
the head of a man protruding from the window, its tongue
almost hanging out. He opened the door of the car and said,
‘Come with me.’
I held back and said, ‘No.’
‘I will pay whatever you ask for.’
‘No,’ I repeated.
‘Believe me, I will pay you anything you want.’
‘You cannot pay my price, it’s very high.’
‘I can pay any price. I’m an Arab prince.’
‘And I am a princess.’
‘I’ll pay a thousand.’
‘No.’
‘Two thousand, then.’
I looked deep into his eyes. I could tell he was a prince or
from the ruling family, for there was a lurking fear in their
depths. ‘Three thousand,’ I said. ‘I accept.’
In the soft luxurious bed, I closed my eyes, and let my
body slip away from me. It was still young and vigorous,
strong enough to retreat, powerful enough to resist. I felt his
body bearing down on my breast, heavy with long untold
years of his life, swollen with stagnant sweat. A body full of
ﬂesh from years of eating beyond his needs, beyond his
greed. With every movement he kept repeating the same
stupid question:
‘Do you feel pleasure?’
And I would close my eyes and say, ‘Yes.’
Each time he rejoiced like a happy fool, and repeated his
question with a gasping breath and each time I gave the
same answer: ‘Yes.’
With the passing moments his foolishness grew, and with
it his assurance that my repeated aﬃrmations of pleasure
were true. Every time I said ‘yes’ he beamed at me like an
idiot, and an instant later I could feel the weight of his body
bear down on me, more heavily than before. I could stand
no more, and just when he was on the point of repeating the
same stupid question again, I snapped out angrily,
‘No!’
When he held out his hand with the money, I was still
wildly angry with him. I snatched the notes from his hand
and tore them up into little pieces with a pent-up fury.
The feel of the notes under my ﬁngers was the same as
that of the ﬁrst piastre ever held between them. The
movement of my hands as I tore the money to pieces, tore
oﬀ the veil, the last, remaining veil from before my eyes, to
reveal the whole enigma which had puzzled me throughout,
the true enigma of my life. I rediscovered the truth I had
already discovered many years before when my father held
out his hand to me with the ﬁrst piastre he had ever given
me. I returned to the money in my hand and with a
redoubled fury tore the remaining bank notes into shreds. It
was as though I was destroying all the money I had ever
held, my father’s piastre, my uncle’s piastre, all the piastres
I had ever known, and at the same time destroying all the
men I had ever known, one after the other in a row: my
uncle, my husband, my father, Marzouk and Bayoumi, Di’aa,
Ibrahim, and tearing them all to pieces one after the other,
ridding myself of them once and for all, removing every
trace their piastres had left on my ﬁngers, tearing away the
very ﬂesh of my ﬁngers to leave nothing but bone, ensuring
that not a single vestige of these men would remain at all.
His eyes opened wide in amazement as he watched me
tear up the whole sheaf of bank notes. I heard him say:
‘You are verily a princess. How did I not believe you right
from the start?’
‘I’m not a princess,’ I said angrily.
‘At ﬁrst I thought you were a prostitute.’
‘I am not a prostitute. But right from my early days my
father, my uncle, my husband, all of them, taught me to
grow up as a prostitute.’
The prince laughed as he eyed me again and then said,
‘You are not telling the truth. From your face, I can see you
are the daughter of a king.’
‘My father was no diﬀerent from a king except for one
thing.’
‘And what is that?’
‘He never taught me to kill. He left me to learn it alone as
I went through life.’
‘Did life teach you to kill?’
‘Of course it did.’
‘And have you killed anybody yet?’
‘Yes, I have.’
He stared at me for a brief moment, laughed and then
said, ‘I can’t believe that someone like you can kill.’
‘Why not?’
‘Because you are too gentle.’
‘And who said that to kill does not require gentleness?’
He looked into my eyes again, laughed, and said, ‘I cannot
believe that you are capable of killing anything, even a
mosquito.’
‘I might not kill a mosquito, but I can kill a man.’
He stared at me once more, but this time only very
quickly, then said, ‘I do not believe it.’
‘How can I convince you that what I say is true?’
‘I do not really know how you can do that.’
So I lifted my hand high up above my head and landed it
violently on his face.
‘Now you can believe that I have slapped you. Burying a
knife in your neck is just as easy and requires exactly the
same movement.’
This time, when he looked at me, his eyes were full of fear.
I said, ‘Perhaps now you will believe that I am perfectly
capable of killing you, for you are no better than an insect,
and all you do is to spend the thousands you take from your
starving people on prostitutes.’
Before I had time to raise my hand high up in the air once
more, he screamed in panic like a woman in trouble. He did
not stop screaming until the police arrived on the scene.
He said to the police, ‘Don’t let her go. She’s a criminal, a
killer.’
And they asked me, ‘Is what he says true?’
‘I am a killer, but I’ve committed no crime. Like you, I kill
only criminals.’
‘But he is a prince, and a hero. He’s not a criminal.’
‘For me the feats of kings and princes are no more than
crimes, for I do not see things the way you do.’
‘You are a criminal,’ they said, ‘and your mother is a
criminal.’
‘My mother was not a criminal. No woman can be a
criminal. To be a criminal one must be a man.’
‘Now look here, what is this that you are saying?’
‘I am saying that you are criminals, all of you: the fathers,
the uncles, the husbands, the pimps, the lawyers, the
doctors, the journalists, and all men of all professions.’
They said, ‘You are a savage and dangerous woman.’
‘I am speaking the truth. And truth is savage and
dangerous.’
* * *
They put steel handcuﬀs around my wrists, and led me oﬀ
to prison. In prison they kept me in a room where the
windows and the doors were always shut. I knew why they
were so afraid of me. I was the only woman who had torn
the mask away, and exposed the face of their ugly reality.
They condemned me to death not because I had killed a
man – there are thousands of people being killed every day
– but because they are afraid to let me live. They know that
as long as I am alive they will not be safe, that I shall kill
them. My life means their death. My death means their life.
They want to live. And life for them means more crime,
more plunder, unlimited booty. I have triumphed over both
life and death because I no longer desire to live, nor do I any
longer fear to die. I want nothing. I hope for nothing. I fear
nothing. Therefore I am free. For during life it is our wants,
our hopes, our fears that enslave us. The freedom I enjoy
ﬁlls them with anger. They would like to discover that there
is after all something which I desire, or fear, or hope for.
Then they know they can enslave me once more. Some time
ago one of them came to me and said:
‘There’s hope for your release if you send an appeal to the
President asking him to pardon you for the crime you
committed.’
‘But I don’t want to be released,’ I said, ‘and I want no
pardon for my crime. For what you call my crime was no
crime.’
‘You killed a man.’
‘If I go out once again to the life which is yours I will never
stop killing. So what is the use of my sending an appeal to
the President to be pardoned?’
‘You criminal. You deserve to die.’
‘Everybody has to die. I prefer to die for a crime I have
committed rather than to die for one of the crimes which
you have committed.’
* * *
Now I am waiting for them. After a little while they will come
to take me away. Tomorrow morning I shall no longer be
here. I will be in a place which no one knows. This journey to
an unknown destination, to a place unknown to all those
who live on this earth, be they king or prince, or ruler, ﬁlls
me with pride. All my life I was looking for something that
would ﬁll me with pride, something that would make me
hold my head high, higher than the heads of everyone else,
especially kings, princes and rulers. Every time I picked up a
newspaper with the picture of one of them in it, I would spit
on it. I knew I was only spitting on a piece of newspaper,
which I might need to spread on the shelves of my kitchen,
yet each time I used to spit, and leave the spit to dry on its
own. Anyone who saw me spitting at the picture might think
that I knew the man whose face I was spitting at personally.
But in fact I did not know him. For after all, I’m only a lone
woman. And one woman, no matter who she might be,
cannot possibly know all the men who have their pictures
published in the newspapers. Yes, no matter who she might
be. I was no more than a successful prostitute, and no
matter how successful a prostitute is, she cannot get to
know all men. But with each of the men I ever knew, I was
always overcome by a strong desire to lift my arm high up
over my head and bring my hand smashing down on his
face. Yet because I was afraid I was never able to lift my
hand. Fear made me see this movement as being something
very diﬃcult to carry out. I did not know how to get rid of
this fear, until the moment when I raised my hand for the
ﬁrst time. The movement of my hand upwards and then
downwards destroyed my fear. I realized that it was an easy
movement to execute, much easier than I ever thought it
could be. Now my hand was no longer incapable of lifting
itself high up in the air to land with violence on one of their
faces. The movement of my hand had become very easy,
and everything in my hand could be moved with a natural
ease, even if it were a sharp knife which I thrust into a chest
and then withdrew. It would penetrate in and come out with
the natural ease of air entering the lungs and then ﬂowing
out. I am speaking the truth now without any diﬃculty. For
the truth is always easy and simple. And in its simplicity lies
a savage power. I only arrived at the savage, primitive
truths of life after years of struggle. For it is only very rarely
that people can arrive at the simple, but awesome and
powerful truths of life after only a few years. And to have
arrived at the truth means that one no longer fears death.
For death and truth are similar in that they both require a
great courage if one wishes to face them. And truth is like
death in that it kills. When I killed I did it with truth not with
a knife. That is why they are afraid and in a hurry to execute
me. They do not fear my knife. It is my truth which frightens
them. This fearful truth gives me great strength. It protects
me from fearing death, or life, or hunger, or nakedness, or
destruction. It is this fearful truth which prevents me from
fearing the brutality of rulers and policemen.
I spit with ease on their lying faces and words, on their
lying newspapers.
3 
Firdaus’ voice suddenly fell silent, like a voice in a dream. I
moved my body like someone moving in sleep. What lay
under me was not a bed, but something solid like the
ground, and cold like the ground, yet with a coldness which
did not reach my body. It was the cold of the sea in a dream.
I swam through its waters. I was naked and knew not how to
swim. But I neither felt its cold, nor drowned in its waters.
Her voice was now silent, but its echo remained in my ears,
like a faint distant sound. Like the voices one hears in a
dream. They seem to come from afar although they arise
from close by, or seem to be nearby although they come
from afar. We do not know in fact from where they arise.
From above or below. To our left or our right. We might even
think they come from the depths of the earth, drop from the
rooftops or fall from the heavens. Or they might even ﬂow
from all directions, like air moving in space reaches our
ears. But this was not air ﬂowing into my ears. The woman
sitting on the ground in front of me was a real woman. The
voice ﬁlling my ears with its sound, echoing in the cell
where the window and the door were tightly closed, was a
real voice. And I was certainly awake. For suddenly the door
was thrown open, revealing several armed policemen. They
surrounded her in a circle, and I heard one of them say:
‘Let’s go… Your time has come.’
I saw her walk out with them. I never saw her again. But
her voice continued to echo in my ears, vibrating in my
head, in the cell, in the prison, in the streets, in the whole
world, shaking everything, spreading fear wherever it went,
the fear of the truth which kills, the power of truth, as
savage, and as simple, and as awesome as death, yet as
simple and as gentle as the child that has not yet learnt to
lie.
And because the world was full of lies, she had to pay the
price.
I got into my little car, my eyes on the ground. Inside of
me was a feeling of shame. I felt ashamed of myself, of my
life, of my fears, and my lies. The streets were full of people
bustling around, of newspapers hanging on wooden stalls,
their headlines crying out. At every step, wherever I went, I
could see the lies, could follow hypocrisy bustling around. I
rammed my foot down on the accelerator as though in a
hurry to run over the world, to stamp it all out. But the next
moment I quickly lifted my foot and braked hard, and the
car came to a halt.
And at that moment I realized that Firdaus had more
courage than I.
